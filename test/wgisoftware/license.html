            <h2>Terms & conditions of the software license</h2>
            Flash Point Classifier is proprietary software of WG Inc. and is distributed under terms and conditions of the License Policy and the End-User License Agreement (EULA). The contents of both are found below.

            <h2><a name="license-policy"></a>License policy</h2>
            <h3>Legacy version and authorization policy</h3>
            WG Inc. will only activate the software license on new purchases within the same version or within one year of purchase. Customers with older purchases that require authorization to register and license the software may need to contact us directly. The re-authorization of software licenses under the EULA is dictated by the specific terms of that agreement.

            <h3>Flash Point Classifier</h3>
            The specific version of Flash Point Classifier you license from WG Inc. is perpetual to the original machine (System) that you activate the software on and does not expire. Once the license file is activated on the System, there are restrictions on the frequency with which users may move the license to additional machines. This is dependent on if your Maintenance & Support (M&S) service is current and valid.

            <h3>Maintenance and Support (M&S)</h3>
            Any new purchase of Flash Point Classifier comes with one year of Maintenance & Support service (M&S), which begins on the date of registration of the original purchase. After an initial license purchase or renewal of M&S, users are entitled to download and license all updates to the software released within that period. The M&S service also includes access to technical and licensing support. Transferring the Flash Point Classifier license from the original System to any other machine, or subsequent Systems, requires a valid M&S service. When the twelve-month period is over, users have the option to renew their M&S term, allowing them to retain their initial level of access and support. Please contact our sales team (contact@wgisoftware.com) for more information on the latest renewal rates.

            As users approach the end of their twelve-month M&S service period, they may be contacted via email with the option to renew the service and the Software will provide occasional notices of the pending termination of their current M&S term. If the M&S service is not renewed but is then purchased at a later date, the agreement will begin at the moment the extended M&S term is registered.

            Enrollment in M&S is not intended as a substitute for formal training on the use of the software. 

            <h3>Single-user license</h3>
            A Single-user licenses are locked to one machine ID and may not be licensed concurrently or simultaneously between two Systems. However, it is a portable license if the M&S service term is valid. Under this condition, the license may be moved to license the software from one System to another one at a time. In this sense, the single-user license is a type of "floating license". The end-user must remove and release the license using the facilities provided in the Software before authorizing a new System without having to contact WG Inc. To transfer your license to a new machine, the license must be deactivated before it can be reauthorized. If your M&S service is expired, you will be unable to transfer your license and our team may be unable to assist you with the transfer process. Prior to transferring your license, please be sure to have a copy of the installation files (i.e. the licensed version of the Software). Installation files for legacy versions may not be available for distribution. We strongly recommend that users back up the software installation file upon purchase, as we are not obligated to make legacy installation files available for download.

            Please note that on laptops that use docking stations or wireless network adapters, the Machine ID can change when connected to these devices. If this is the case, ensure the laptop is disconnected from any wireless network adapters or docking stations/devices when requesting or activating a license. Similarly, Windows updates and motherboard replacements can change the Machine ID. Make sure your license is deactivated before these changes. If your M&S service is expired, our team is unable to assist in the recovery of your license.

            <h3>Network license</h3>
            Unfortunately, WG Inc. does not currently offer network licenses for Flash Point Classifier. With this license type, a pool of license seats is hosted on a server, and client machines with communication to the server can check out a license to use while the end-user program is active. Instead, organizations and users who need to access the software from multiple machines must purchase multiple single-user licenses. You may contact WG Inc. (contact@wgisoftware.com) to ask about any applicable discounts in these situations.

            <h3 id="refund-policy">Refund policy</h3>
            WG Inc. understands that our online order process isn't perfect. Mistakes sometimes happen and we promise to do our best 
            to fix any situation within reason. We do ask that if you are uncertain about purchasing our software please e-mail us 
            at <a href="mailto:contact@wgisoftware.com">contact@wgisoftware.com</a> and we would be pleased to answer any questions 
            you may have as well as provide you with pre-sales technical support or evaluation licenses, as appropriate. However, for 
            those few times when mistakes do happen it is important that customers understand that we do not provide refunds. We do 
            provide store credit in some extreme situations but the following are NOT those circumstances:

            <ul>
                <li>The customer mistakenly placed the order.</li>
                <li>The software does not perform a specific feature that is not described in our marketing material or technical documentation.</li>
                <li>After purchase, the software is deemed too “difficult” to use.</li>
                <li>If a defect is found with the Software</li>
            </ul>
