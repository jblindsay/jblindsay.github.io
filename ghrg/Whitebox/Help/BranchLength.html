        <h1>Branch length</h1>

        <p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Maximum branch length (Bmax) is the longest branch length between a grid 
            cell's flowpath and the flowpaths initiated at each of its neighbours. 
            It can be conceptualized as the downslope distance that a volume of 
            water that is split into two portions by a drainage divide would travel 
            before reuniting.</p>

        <div style="text-align:center"><img alt="Bmax" src="img/Bmax2.png" /></div>

        <p>If the two flowpaths of neighbouring grid cells do not intersect, Bmax is 
            simply the flowpath length from the starting cell to its terminus at the 
            edge of the grid or a cell with undefined flow direction (i.e. a pit cell 
            either in a topographic depression or at the edge of a major body of water).</p>

        <p>The pattern of Bmax derived from a DEM should be familiar to anyone who has 
            interpreted upslope contributing area images. In fact, Bmax can be thought 
            of as the complement of upslope contributing area. Whereas contributing area 
            is greatest along valley bottoms and lowest at drainage divides, Bmax is 
            greatest at divides and lowest along channels. The two topographic attributes 
            are also distinguished by their units of measurements; Bmax is a length 
            rather than an area. The presence of a major drainage divide between 
            neighbouring grid cells is apparent in a Bmax image as a linear feature, 
            often two grid cells wide, of relatively high values</p>

        <p>Bmax is useful in the study of landscape structure, particularly with 
            respect to drainage patterns. The index gives the relative significance of 
            a specific location along a divide, with respect to the dispersion of 
            materials across the landscape, in much the same way that stream ordering 
            can be used to assess stream size.</p>

        <h2>Operation</h2>
        <p>The user must specify the name of a flow pointer grid derived using the 
            <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 flow algorithm</a>. In fact, the flow 
            pointer raster could be derived using any non-dispersive flow algorithm 
            that uses the same flow direction naming convention. The user must also 
            specify whether or not to include diagonal neighbours in the calculation.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                pointerFile = wd + "D8 pointer.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                args = [pointerFile, outputFile]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("BranchLength", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def pointerFile = wd + "D8 pointer.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                String[] args = [pointerFile, outputFile]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("BranchLength", args, false)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
