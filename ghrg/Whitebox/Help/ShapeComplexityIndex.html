        <h1>Shape complexity index</h1>

        <p>This tool provides a measure of overall polygon shape complexity, or 
            irregularity, for both raster and vector features. Several shape 
            indices have been created to compare a polygon's shape to simple 
            Euclidean shapes (e.g. circles, squares, etc.). One of the problems 
            with this approach is that it inherently convolves the 
            characteristics of polygon complexity and elongation. The Shape 
            Complexity Index (<i>SCI</i>) was developed as a parameter for assessing 
            the complexity of a polygon that is independent of its elongation. 
            In fact, the <i>SCI</i> has a different definition for vector polygons and 
            raster polygons. For vector features, <i>SCI</i> relates a polygon's shape 
            to that of an encompassing convex hull. It is defined as:

            <br><br><code>SCI = 1 - A / A<sub>h</sub></code><br> <br>Where 
            where <i>A</i> is the polygon's area and <i>A<sub>h</sub></i> is 
            the area of the convex hull containing the polygon. Convex 
            polygons, i.e. those that do not contain concavities, have a value 
            of 0. As the shape of the polygon becomes more complex, the <i>SCI</i> 
            approaches 1. Note that polygon shape complexity also increases 
            with the greater number of holes (i.e. islands), since holes have 
            the effect of reducing the lake area. The <i>SCI</i> values 
            calculated for each vector polygon feature will be placed in 
            the accompanying database file (.dbf) as a complexity field 
            (COMPLEXITY). The resulting database file will be displayed 
            automatically after the tool has completed.</p>

        <p>For raster polygons, the <i>SCI</i> is the average number of line 
            intersections with polygon boundaries averaged for the N-S, E-W, 
            NW-SE, and NE-SW directions. Convex polygons will have a value of 2 
            and more irregular shaped polygons, including those containing holes, 
            will have higher values. The input raster grid should contain 
            polygons with unique identifiers greater than zero. The user must 
            also specify the name of the output raster file (where the radius of 
            gyration will be assigned to each feature in the input file) and 
            the specified option of outputting text data.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                inputFile = wd + "polygons.shp" # vector input<br>
                outputFile = "" # ignored for vector input<br>
                textOutput = "false" # also ignored<br>
                args = [inputFile, outputFile, textOutput]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ShapeComplexityIndex", args, False)<br>
            </code>

        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def inputFile = wd + "polygons.dep" // raster input<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                def textOutput = "true"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFile, outputFile, textOutput]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ShapeComplexityIndex", args, False)<br>
