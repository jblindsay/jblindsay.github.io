<h1>User-defined weights filter</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to perform a convolution-type filter where the weights
of the moving window, or kernel, are specified by the user. As such, this tool
provides a convenient means of creating a custom filter or performing a filter
type that is not currently available as a standard tool in Whitebox. The user
must specify the names of the input and output images and the location of the
centre of the moving kernel (defaults to centre of window but you can also
specify one of the corners). The custom weights are then entered into the grid.
The grid has room to accomodate up to an 11x11 filter, though there is not need
to fill in values for all of these window cells for smaller sized filters. For
example, if a 3x3 sized filter is required, enter numerical values into the
first three rows and columns of the grid, leaving the remaining grid cells
blank. The user may also specify a <b><i>Divisor</i></b>. This value can serve
to normalize the weight values, thereby ensuring that the output image will
possess values within the range of the input image. Use of a non-unity valued
<b><i>Divisor</i></b> allows the user to specify integer value weights if
desired. 

<p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the input image are replaced with the average
value of all valid cells within the kernel. This is also the procedure when the
neighbourhood around a grid cell extends beyond the edge of the grid. The
output raster is of the <i>float</i> data type and <i>continuous</i> data
scale.</p>
