        <h1>Principal component analysis</h1>

        <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a common data reduction 
            technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of multi-dimensional 
            space. In the field of remote sensing, PCA is often used to reduce the 
            number of bands of multi-spectral, or hyper-spectral, imagery. 
            <a href="ImageCorrelation.html">Image correlation</a> analysis 
            often reveals a substantial level of correlation among bands of 
            multi-spectral imagery. This correlation represents data redundancy, i.e. 
            fewer images than the number of bands are required to represent the same 
            information, where the information is related to variation within the 
            imagery. PCA transforms the original data set of <i>n</i> bands into 
            <i>n</i> 'component' images, where each component image is uncorrelated 
            with all other components. The technique works by transforming the axes 
            of the multi-spectral space such that it coincides with the directions 
            of greatest correlation. Each of these new axes are orthogonal to one 
            another, i.e. they are at right angles. PCA is therefore a type of 
            coordinate system transformation. The PCA component images are 
            arranged such that the greatest amount of variance (or information) 
            within the original data set, is contained within the first component 
            and the amount of variance decreases with each component. It is 
            often the case that the majority of the information contained in a 
            multi-spectral data set can be represented by the first three or 
            four PCA components. The higher-order components are often 
            associated with noise in the original data set.</p>

        <p>The user must specify the names of the multiple input images. 
            Additionally, the user must specify whether to perform a 
            standardized PCA and the number of output components to 
            generate (all components will be output unless otherwise 
            specified). A standardized PCA is performed using the correlation 
            matrix rather than the variance-covariance matrix. This is 
            appropriate when the variances in the input images differ 
            substantially, such as would be the case if they contained values 
            that were recorded in different units (e.g. feet and meters) or 
            on different scales (e.g. 8-bit vs. 16 bit).</p>

        <p>Several outputs will be generated when the tool has completed. A text 
            report will output into the text area at the bottom of the Whitebox 
            user-interface. This report contains useful data and it is advisable  
            to save it for later reference by right-clicking over the text area 
            and selecting 'Save'. The first table that is in the PCA report 
            lists the amount of explained variance (in non-cumulative and 
            cumulative form), the eigenvalue, and the eigenvector for each 
            component. Each of the PCA components refer to the newly created, 
            transformed images that are created by running the tool, the first 
            three of which are automatically displayed when the tool completes. 
            The amount of explained variance associated with each component 
            can be thought of as a measure of how much information content 
            within the original multi-spectral data set that a component has. 
            The higher this value is, the more important the component is. 
            This same information is presented in graphical form in the 'Scree 
            Plot' that is also output by the tool. Note that you can save the 
            scree plot by right-clicking over the plot and selecting 'Save'. The 
            eigenvalue is another measure of the information content of a 
            component and the eigenvector describes the mathematical 
            transformation (rotation coordinates) that correspond to a 
            particular component image.</p>

        <p><i>Factor Loadings</i> are also output in a table within the PCA text 
            report. These loading values describe the correlation (i.e. <i>r</i> 
            values) between each of the PCA components (columns) and the 
            original images (rows). These values show you how the information 
            contained in an image is spread among the components. An analysis 
            of factor loadings can be reveal useful information about the 
            data set. For example, it can help to identify groups of similar 
            images.</p>
        
        <p>PCA is used to reduce the number of band images necessary for 
            classification (i.e. as a data reduction technique), for noise 
            reduction, and for change detection applications. When used as a 
            change detection technique, the major PCA components tend to be 
            associated with stable elements of the data set while variance due to 
            land-cover change tend to manifest in the high-order, 'change 
            components'. When used as a noise reduction technique, an inverse PCA 
            is generally performed, leaving out one or more of the high-order 
            PCA components, which account for noise variance. An inverse PCA can 
            be performed using the <a href="InversePrincipalComponentAnalysis.html">
                <b><i>Inverse Principal Component Analysis</i></b></a> tool.</p>
        
        <p>While this tool is intended to be applied to imagery data, PCA can 
        also be performed on the attributes of a vector file using the 
        <a href="PCAForAttributes.html"><b><i>PCA For Attributes</i></b></a> 
        tool.</p>
