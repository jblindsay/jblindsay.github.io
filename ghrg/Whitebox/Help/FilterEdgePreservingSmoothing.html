        <h1>Edge-preserving smoothing filter</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to perform an <b><i>edge-preserving smoothing 
                    filter</i></b>, or bilateral filter, on a raster image. A 
            bilateral filter can be used to emphasize the longer-range 
            variability in an image, effectively acting to smooth the 
            image, while reducing the edge blurring effect common with 
            other types of smoothing filters. As such, this filter is very 
            useful for reducing the noise in an image. Bilateral filtering is a 
            non-linear filtering technique introduced by 
            <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~manduchi/Papers/ICCV98.pdf">Tomasi 
                and Manduchi (1998)</a>. The algorithm operates by convolving a 
            kernel of weights with each grid cell and its neighbours in an 
            image. The bilateral filter is related to Gaussian smoothing, in 
            that the weights of the convolution kernel are partly determined 
            by the 2-dimensional Gaussian (i.e. normal) curve, which gives 
            stronger weighting to cells nearer the kernel centre. Unlike the 
            <b><i>Gaussian filter</i></b>, however, the bilateral kernel 
            weightings are also affected by their similarity to the intensity 
            value of the central pixel. Pixels that are very different in 
            intensity from the central pixel are weighted less, also based on a 
            Gaussian weight distribution. Therefore, this non-linear convolution 
            filter is determined by the spatial and intensity domains of a 
            localized pixel neighborhood.</p>

        <p>The heavier weighting given to nearer and similar-valued pixels makes 
            the bilateral filter an attractive alternative for image smoothing 
            and noise reduction compared to the much-used 
            <a href="FilterMean.html">Mean filter</a>. The size of the filter is 
            determined by setting the standard deviation distance parameter; the 
            larger the standard deviation the larger the resulting filter kernel. 
            The standard deviation can be any number in the range 0.5-20 and is 
            specified in the unit of pixels. The standard deviation intensity 
            parameter, specified in the same units as the z-values, determines 
            the intensity domain contribution to kernel weightings.</p>

        <p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the input image are ignored during 
            filtering. When the neighbourhood around a grid cell extends beyond 
            the edge of the grid, <b><i>NoData</i></b> values are assigned to 
            these sites. The output raster is of the <i>float</i> data type and 
            <i>continuous</i> data scale.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                inputFile = wd + "input.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                stddDevDist = "0.75"<br>
                stdDevIntensity = "10.0"<br>
                reflectEdges = "true"<br>
                args = [inputFile, outputFile, stddDevDist, stdDevIntensity, reflectEdges]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("FilterEdgePreservingSmoothing", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using the tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def inputFile = wd + "input.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                def stddDevDist = "2.5"<br>
                def stdDevIntensity = "4.0"<br>
                def reflectEdges = "true"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFile, outputFile, stddDevDist, stdDevIntensity, reflectEdges]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("FilterEdgePreservingSmoothing", args, false)<br>
