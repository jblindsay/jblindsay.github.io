        <h1>Change vector analysis</h1>

        <p>Change Vector Analysis (CVA) is a change detection 
            method that characterizes the magnitude and change direction in 
            spectral space between two times. A change vector is the difference 
            vector between two vectors in <i>n</i>-dimensional 
            <a href="FeatureVectorAndFeatureSpace.html">feature space</a> 
            defined for two observations of the same geographical location 
            (i.e. corresponding pixels) during two dates. The CVA inputs include 
            the set of raster images corresponding to the multispectral data for 
            each date. Note that there must be the same number of image files 
            (bands) for the two dates and they must be entered in the same order, 
            i.e. if three bands, red, green, and blue are entered for date one, 
            these same bands must be entered in the same order for date two. </p>
            
        <p>CVA outputs two image files. The first image contains the change 
            vector length, i.e. magnitude, for each pixel in the multi-spectral 
            dataset. The second image contains information about the direction 
            of the change event in spectral feature space, which is related to 
            the type of change event, e.g. deforestation will likely have a 
            different change direction than say crop growth. The vector magnitude 
            is a continuous numerical variable. The change vector direction is 
            presented in the form of a code, referring to the multi-dimensional 
            sector in which the change vector occurs. A text output will be 
            produced to provide a key describing sector codes, relating the 
            change vector to positive or negative shifts in <i>n</i>-dimensional 
            <a href="FeatureVectorAndFeatureSpace.html">feature space</a>.</p> 
            
        <p>It is common to apply a simple thresholding operation on the magnitude 
            data to determine 'actual' change (i.e. change above some assumed 
            level of error). The type of change (qualitatively) is then defined 
            according to the corresponding sector code. Jensen (2005) provides 
            a useful description of this approach to change detection.
