        <h1>Image rectification</h1>

        <p>This tool is used to perform image-to-map rectification, i.e. transform the 
            geometric properties of an image to match that of a projected map, or image-to-
            image registration. Image-to-map rectification is commonly used when an image 
            must be overlayed with other geographic data, e.g a road network, and image-to-
            image registration is usually only carried out for change detection applications 
            where two images must be exactly co-registered on a pixel-to-pixel basis. The 
            two operations follow the same approach. A collection of ground control points 
            (GCPs) must be digitized on the input image. These GCPs are input to the tool in 
            the form of a shapefile of a Point ShapeType. This file can be created through 
            on-screen digitizing into a blank shapefile created using the 
            <a href="CreateNewShapefile.html"><b><i>Create New Shapefile</i></b></a> tool. 
            Each control point in the image GCP file must have a corresponding GCP digitized 
            in the reference coordinate system (i.e. either in the map coordinates or the 
            coordinate system of a second reference image for rectification and registration 
            respectively) and contained in the map GCP shapefile.</p>

        <p>Once the user specifies the names of the input files and output image file, 
            they will be presented with the rectification dialog, which displays information 
            about the transformation error associated with each GCP and the overall root-mean-
            square-error (RMSE). The user can optionally deactivate individual, poorly 
            performing GCPs to reduce the RMSE. The transformation is based on a two-variable 
            (X, Y) polynomial transformation. The order of the polynomial can range between 
            1 (an affine transformation) and 5. Satellite imagery can typically be rectified 
            using a low-order transform (e.g. 1-2), while sub-orbital imagery usually requires 
            a higher-order transform (e.g. 2-4). Although higher-order polynomials generally 
            reduce the overall error, it is often the case that the improved fit is localized 
            to the areas immediately adjacent to the GCPs and undesirable warping can occur 
            in regions not covered by GCPs. As such, it is recommended that the lowest order 
            polynomial that allows for a reasonably good fit to the data be applied. Affine 
            transformations can account for geometric distortions resulting from translation, 
            scaling, rotation, and skew. The success of a rectification operation is highly 
            dependent on the number, placement, and quality of GCPs. Furthermore, the higher 
            the order of polynomial transformation the greater the number of GCPs that are 
            required. The mathematically defined minimum number of GCPs for a 1, 2, 3, 4, 
            and 5 order polynomial transformation are 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21 respectively. 
            However, in reality many more than the mathematical minimum number of GCPs are 
            required to rectify imagery adequately.</p>

        <p>This tool requires a higher level of user interaction than most other 
            tools and is not intended for a scripting environment.</p>
