<h1>Breach depressions</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to pre-process a digital elevation model (DEM) prior to being used for 
hydrological analysis. It will remove topographic depressions and apparent dams in the DEM in 
order to enforce continuous flow. This is achieved by breaching through topographic barriers.
 As such, depression breaching provides an alternative to <a href="FillDepressions.html">depression filling</a>. 
 Unlike depression filling, which has one unique solution for each depression, there may be several 
 competing solutions for depression breaching. This tool uses a cost-distance criteria for deciding 
 upon the breach target, i.e. the cell to which the tool will trench a connecting path, and for 
 determining the breach path itself. As such, the trenched path will not necessarily follow a straight 
 line, but rather, will follow a path of lowest cost, where the cost is determined by the amount of 
 change made to the original DEM.</p>
