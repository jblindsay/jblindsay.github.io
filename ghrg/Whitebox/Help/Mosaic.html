        <h1>Mosaic</h1>

        <p>This tool will create an image mosaic from one or more <i>input image
                files</i> using one of three resampling methods including, nearest neighbour,
            bilinear interpolation, and cubic convolution.The order of the input source
            image files is important. Grid cells in the output image will be assigned the
            corresponding value determined from the <i>first</i> image found in the list to
            possess an overlapping coordinate.</p>

        <p>The <i>Nearest neighbour</i> resampling approach assigns each grid cell in
            the destination image the value of the nearest grid cell corresponding the the
            same x- y- coordinates in the source images. The <i>Bilinear</i> resampling
            method interpolates a new value based on the nearest four grid cells in one of
            the source images. The <i>Cubic convolution</i> resampling method interpolates
            a new value based on the nearest 16 grid cells in one of the source images.
            Notice that only the <i>Nearest neighbour</i> method is appropriate with
            categorical data, while the other two approaches often give better results for
            data on a continuous scale. The <i>Nearest neighbour</i> method is the fastest
            of the three, followed by <i>Bilinear</i>, followed by <i>Cubic
                convolution</i>, which is comparably slow in operation.</p>

        <p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values are ignored during resampling. Notice that if
            the <b><i>Bilinear</i></b> or <b><i>Cubic convolution</i></b> resampling
            methods are selected, the destination image should be of the <i>float</i> data
            type and <i>continuous</i> data scale as the output will contain floating-point
            values (i.e. decimal numbers).</p>
        <p>The <a href="MosaicWithFeathering.html"><b><i>Mosaic With Feathering</i></b></a> 
            tool provides superior radiometric interpolation within the area of overlap 
            in image pairs and is therefore the preferred method of mosaicing images with 
            extended overlapping regions.</p>

        <h2 class="SeeAlso"><i>Resample</i> Versus <i>Mosaic</i></h2>

        <p><b><i><a href="Resample.html">Resample</a></i></b> is very similar in
            operation to the <b><i>Mosaic</i></b> tool. The <b><i>Resample</i></b> tool
            should be used when there is an existing image into which you would like to
            dump information from one or more source images. If the source images are more
            extensive than the destination image, i.e. there are areas that extend beyond
            the destination image boundaries, these areas will not be represented in the
            updated image. Grid cells in the destination image that are not overlapping
            with any of the input source images will not be updated, i.e. they will possess
            the same value as before the resampling operation. The <b><i>Mosaic</i></b>
            tool is used when there is no existing destination image. In this case, a new
            image is created that represents the bounding rectangle of each of the two or
            more input images. Grid cells in the output image that do not overlap with any
            of the input images will be assigned the <b><i>NoData</i></b> value.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                # You may have multiple input files but they must<br>
                # be separated by semicolons in the string.<br>
                inputFiles = wd + "input1.dep" + ";" + wd + "input2.dep" + ";" + wd + "input3.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                resamplingMethod = "nearest neighbour"<br>
                args = [inputFiles, outputFile, resamplingMethod]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("Mosaic", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                // You may have multiple input files but they must<br>
                // be separated by semicolons in the string.<br>
                def inputFiles = wd + "input1.dep" + ";" + wd + "input2.dep" + ";" + wd + "input3.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                def resamplingMethod = "bilinear"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFiles, outputFile, resamplingMethod]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("Mosaic", args, false)<br>
            </code>
