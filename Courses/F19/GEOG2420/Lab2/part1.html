<p>Open QGIS and display the raster file Guelph_A19411-17.tif. This is a scanned image of a hard copy aerial photograph taken in 1966 of the Guelph area. Importantly, the image is not georeferenced (i.e. it's using a coordinate reference system based on the rows and columns called 'Generated CRS (Authority ID USER: 100000). In fact, the image is not even oriented such that north points upwards. Take some time to orient yourself with the image, looking for familiar landmarks such as the university campus. Notice that the campus was on the outskirts of the city and looked very different than it does today. You can make out the track, Johnston Green, and the Hutt building (built in 1933) are present, but other landmarks like the South residence and University Centre are absent in this old air photo. Guelph has also changed a great deal in the time since this photo was taken, particularly on the south-end. After you have spend some time exploring the image, right-click over the image's entry in the Layers tab and select 'Properties' and click on 'Information'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1. What are the number of rows and columns, and the North, South, East and West coordinates, i.e. extent, of the image? (6 marks)</p>
<p>1.2. What organization was responsible for the collection of this aerial photograph? (1 mark)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will now calculate the resolution of this image. To do this you will need to measure an image distance, <strong>in map units</strong> (pixels), and the ground distance between the corresponding points on a map. The image resolution is then equal to the ground distance (in meters) divided by the image distance (in pixels). Before you begin, overlay the file PhotoIntersectionMarkers.shp onto the image. QGIS defaults to displaying vector layers with randomly selected colours, which may not show up very well on your map. You may want to therefore modify the symbology of the vector to a more noticeable colour like yellow. Once you have an appropriate symbology, you will see that this file identifies two road intersections; the lower point is the intersection of College Rd. and Victoria Rd. and the upper point is the intersection of Highway 124 and Township Rd. 1. The line connecting these two points passes near the image centre (i.e. the principal point) and traverses a significant length of the overall image width. Use the <strong>Measure Line</strong> tool (the ruler icon on the toolbar; see figure below) to estimate the distance between the two points. Be sure to change the measure to map units, which are in pixels. You will be able to measure a more accurate distance if you zoom closer into the points.</p>
<p><img src="img/distance_measure.png" alt="distance_measure" /></p>
<p>Once you have measured and recorded your photo distance, close all of the open data layers (i.e. the photo and the Shapefile) and add the layers 'GuelphLandsatComposite.tif', 'guelph roads.shp', and 'IntersectionMarkers.shp' to the map view. Notice that the layer 'IntersectionMarkers.shp' depicts the same two road intersection, this time on the properly georeferenced map coordinates. Use the QGIS  <strong>Measure Line</strong> tool to measure the distance between the road intersections in meters (again you may need to update the dialog to specify meters). For the map distance, be sure to use the vector road network as you guide for positioning the distance tool. The Landsat image is of a very poor resolution and is only there as a reference aid. Also note that you can zoom into the image to more accurately position the distance tool. The accuracy of your measure will depend on how well you position the cursor and how closely you zoom into the points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.3. What are the image and ground distances between the road intersections? What is the grid resolution? (3 marks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only information that came with the hard copy of this air photo was a handwritten note on the envelope that stated it was taken at a flying height of 20,000 feet (6096 m) above sea level (ASL). The elevation of the ground surface in the image ranges from about 305 m near the river to about 330 m near the university campus, with an average elevation of approximately 320 m. There are many photogrammetric operations that require knowledge of the camera geometry, and specifically the focal length, which unfortunately is unknown. Focal lengths of cameras used for aerial surveys are usually either 6 inches (152.4 mm) or 12 inches (304.8 mm), although their precise focal lengths, which can vary from these theoretical values ever so slightly, are calculated during camera calibration.
In order to calculate the focal length of the camera used to capture this photograph, you will need to know the photo scale of the original image. To calculate the photo scale, you will need to relate a known distance on the original hard-copy photograph to a corresponding ground distance. Although you only have a scanned copy of the original photo, there is a known distance that you can use. Like the vast majority of film-based aerial photography this photograph has been acquired using large-format 9 inch x 9 inch (229 mm x 229 mm) film. Thus, the distance from one edge to the opposing edge on the original air photo is 229 mm. Use your calculation of the grid resolution above to estimate what the corresponding ground distance is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.4. What is the scale of the original aerial photograph? Be sure to show your work. (3 marks)</p>
<p>1.5. Given the flying height, the average ground elevation, the calculated photo scale, and the relation between these things and focal length (described above), calculate the focal length (in mm) of the camera. (2 marks)</p>
<p>1.6. Based on your calculated focal length and your knowledge of the common focal lengths of cameras used in aerial surveys, how accurate do you think that the flying height noted on the photos envelope was? (2 marks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close all open layers and then add the raster layer 'GuelphCampus254.tif'. This is an image of a section of the university campus. You'll notice based on one of the gauges on the right-hand side of the photo that the calibrated focal length of the camera used to acquire this image is 152.420 mm. Also, the aircraft altitude was 6855 ft. Remember the average ground elevation is 330 m near the university campus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.7. Using the relationship scale = <em>f</em> / AGL, calculate the photograph scale. Be sure to show your work, including unit conversions. (4 marks)</p>
<p>1.8. Calculate the scale of the original aerial photograph, remembering to show your work. (3 marks)</p>
<p>1.9. Which of the two images has the larger scale? (1 mark)</p>
<p>1.10. What time of day was this image taken during? (2 marks)</p>
<p>1.11. Provide four examples of changes that have occurred since the time this photo was taken. (4 marks)</p>
