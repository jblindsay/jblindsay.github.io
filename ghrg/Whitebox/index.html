      <a id="contentstart"></a><h1>Welcome to the Whitebox GAT Project</h1>
		  <p class="bodyText">
        The Whitebox GAT project began in 2009 and was conceived as a replacement for the
        <a href="../publications.html#tas">Terrain Analysis System</a> (TAS). Whitebox GAT was intended to
        have a broader focus than its predecessor, positioning it as an open-source desktop GIS and remote sensing
        software package for general applications of geospatial analysis and data visualization. Whitebox GAT is
        intended to provide a platform for advanced geospatial data analysis with applications in both environmental
        research and the geomatics industry more broadly. It was envisioned from the outset as
        providing an ideal platform for experimenting with novel geospatial analysis methods. Equally important
        is the project’s goal of providing a tool that can be used for geomatics-based education.

        <p class="bodyText">
          Whitebox GAT should not be confused with the related project, <strong>WhiteboxTools</strong>, which is
          a stand-alone command-line program and Python scripting API for geospatial analysis. Check out the
          <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/software.shtml#WhiteboxTools">WhiteboxTools project
          homepage</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-geospatial-analysis-tools/tree/master/whitebox_tools">
          GitHub source code repository</a> for more details.

        <h2>Whitebox GAT is open-access</h2>
        <p class="bodyText">
          An important characteristic of Whitebox GAT is the unique <em>open-access</em> development philosophy adopted by
          the project, which lends itself to experimenting with geospatial algorithm development. Open-access
          software can be viewed as a complementary extension to the traditional open-source software (OSS) model
          of development. The concept of open access has been previously defined in the context of publishing
          scholarly literature in a way that removes financial, legal, and technical access barriers to knowledge
          transfer. Although this definition of open access focuses solely on
          research publications, we argued that the stated goals of reducing barriers associated with knowledge
          transfer applies equally to the software used in research. Open-access software is distinct from other
          OSS in that it has an explicitly stated design goal of reducing barriers to the transfer of knowledge
          to the user community. Direct insight into the workings of algorithm design and implementation allows
          for educational opportunities and increases the potential for rapid innovation, experimentation with
          algorithms, and community-directed development. This is particularly important in geomatics because
          many geospatial algorithms are complex and are strongly affected by implementation details. Also,
          there are often multiple competing algorithms for accomplishing the same task and the choice of one
          method over another can greatly impact the outcome of a workflow.
        </p>
        <div class="backgroundSection">
          <p class="quoteText">
            "Open-access software is designed from the project’s inception in a way that reduces the barriers
            that typically discourage end-users from examining the algorithm and implementation details
            associated with software artifacts."
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="bodyText">
          All OSS allow users the opportunity to download the source code and inspect the software’s internal
          workings. However, traditional OSS often does not lend itself to end-user source code inspection.
          Open-access software, by comparison, is designed from the project’s inception in a way that reduces
          the barriers that typically discourage end-users from examining the algorithm and implementation details
          associated with specific software artifacts. Whitebox GAT attempts to address some of the barriers
          to knowledge transfer by allowing users to view the source code associated with each tool directly
          from the tool’s dialog simply by pressing the <em>View Code</em> button (see above). This functionality
          removes the need to download separate, and often large, project source code files and eliminates the
          requisite familiarity with the project to identify the code sections related to the operation of the
          tool of interest. The <em>View Code</em> button is the embodiment of a design philosophy that is
          intended to empower the user community. This model has the potential to encourage further community
          involvement and experimentation with geospatial analysis techniques.
        </p>

        <p class="bodyText">Among the group of users that
          are comfortable with GIS programming and development, the ability to readily view the code associated
          with a specific tool can allow rapid transfer of knowledge and best-practices. This model encourages
          more rapid development because new functionality can be created simply by modifying existing code. For
          scripting-based plug-in tools, users can open the tool’s source code in the <em>Scripter</em>, modify
          the code to alter functionality, and save the modified code as a new plug-in tool. Users may experiment
          without worrying about breaking existing functionality because each script-based tool can be automatically repaired simply by
          updating from the central code repository. So play with it, experiment and have fun. That's the
          Whitebox way. Whitebox GAT is the GIS for the kind of person who as a kid, just had to take the toaster
          apart to see how it works. Whitebox GAT is the GIS for the kind of person who feels uncomfortable pressing
          the OK button without knowing exactly what is going on behind the scenes.
