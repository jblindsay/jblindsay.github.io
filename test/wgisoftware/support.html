            <h2>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2>
            
            <h3>What feature classes does Flash Point Classifier offer?</h3>
            <p>Currently, points can be categorized as low/high noise, ground, building (roof and facade), power lines, poles, 
                low/medium/high vegetation, paved surfaces (roads and parking lots), and water.</p>

            <h3>Can Flash Point Classifier be used to filter out points of certain classes?</h3>
            <p>Yes, part of the FPC workflow allows users to selectively remove specified point classes from data sets.</p>

            <h3>Do I need a license to use Flash Point Classifier?</h3>
            <p>Yes, running FPC does require a valid license for the software, which you can <a href="purchase.html">purchase 
                from here</a>. Licenses are perpetual, and a valid license grants you the ability to use FPC for as long as you 
                operate your computer. In addition to the license, the purchase of a license also comes with a 365-day maintenance & 
                support term.</p>

            <h3>What does my maintenance and support (M&S) term provide me?</h3>
            <p>A valid M&S term grants the user the ability to run any updates to the software during the term. It also allows
                the user to contact WG Inc. (<a href="mailto:contact@wgisoftware.com">contact@wgisoftware.com</a>) with queries 
                about installation and usage of the software. A valid M&S term is also required to transfer your license to another 
                computer. That is, your M&S term grants you the ability to use the floating license model; you may use FPC on any 
                computer but cannot run it on more than one computer simultaneously. When your M&S term expires, you can 
                <a href="purchase.html">purchase a new extended M&S term for your license from here.</a>.</p>

            <h3>Do you offer free trials?</h3>
            <p>Yes, anyone can download the FPC software from our site and start using it for evaluation purposes. Without a valid 
                license, the software will automatically add a random error to the output classified point clouds; the magnitude of 
                error increases each day until you register a license for the software. A message will be issued to the user warning 
                them that they are operating on a trial license and that random error is being added to the output.</p>

            <h3>Can I change the order of a classification workflow?</h3>
            <p>No, at the moment, is not possible to change the order of individual classifiers in a classification workflow; you 
                can only turn individual classifiers on/off. This is because certain classifiers require that other classifiers have 
                been applied earlier. For example, each of the building, powerline, vegetation, water, and road classifiers require 
                that ground points have already been labelled.</p>

            <h3>What input file formats are supported?</h3>
            <p>FPC can read LAS and LAZ formats. User may also input e57 point clouds and the software will automatically convert 
                these files into a LAS file, which is then used for classification.</p>

            <h3>What output file formats are supported?</h3>
            <p>FPC will write LAS, LAZ and PLY files. For LAS/LAZ file output, the user may specify the version of the LAS 
                specification (*View Application Settings* -> *Default output LAS format*). Output files can optionally contain 
                color data (RGB values) associated with each class category (see *Output Files* -> *Colorize points by class* in 
                the *Classification Workflows* panel). The user may also optionally choose to calculate and associate point normal 
                vectors when the output is a PLY file (see *Output Files* settings in the *Classification Workflows* panel).</p>

            <h3>What operating systems are supported?</h3>
            <p>Currently, FPC is only available on Microsoft Windows and MacOS. We do not support Linux based operating systems at 
                present.</p>

            <h3>Can Flash Point Classifier be used for classifying ground-based lidar?</h3>
            <p>FPC has been designed with airborne lidar, including UAV-based lidar systems and platforms, in mind. While it is 
                possible to apply it to point clouds collected with ground-based lidar systems, it may not work as well on these 
                data sets.</p>

            <h3>Does Flash Point Classifier use artificial intelligence (AI) in its classifiers?</h3>
            <p>No, the FPC classifiers do not rely on machine-learning based or pre-trained deep-learning based classifiers. 
                These approaches offer certain advantages in lidar point classification applications, most notably, they have been 
                shown to frequently provide accurate classifications with minimal user intervention required in the way of adjusting 
                parameters. However, this can be viewed as an disadvantage of ML and AI based approach as well. As with all 
                classification applications, there are times when advanced ML and AI based methods will perform poorly on certain 
                data sets. Given the black-box nature of these models, it is impossible when this happens to improve the performance 
                of the classification model because the user does not have the ability to adjust the internal parameters. With FPC, 
                you can always experiment with adjusting each classifier's parameter values until you find an optimally performing 
                parameter set. Remember however, all of these classification models, including deep-learning AI models, are imperfect 
                and some manual classification is sometimes necessary, depending on the application and the accuracy requirements of 
                the project.</p>
