<h1>Opportunities in the GHRG</h1>

<h2>NSERC-funded Masters and PhD opportunities researching multi-scale geomorphometry</h2>
<p class="bodyText">Geomorphometry is the discipline focused on extracting information from topographic data to model 
  and understand landscape processes. Topography controls many phenomena of interest in environmental modelling applications. 
  For example, it affects the distribution of water, nutrients, and sediments, and climate properties, such as air and surface 
  temperature, solar radiation, and wind exposure. Over the past decades, improved topographic mapping technologies and 
  analysis methods have underpinned many advances in soils and habitat mapping, flood forecasting and hydrologic modelling, 
  sediment modelling, hazards mapping, and geological resource inventorying.
</p>

<p class="bodyText">The outputs of geomorphometric analysis, which often take the form of maps of topographic properties, 
  are frequently used as inputs for environment models. One of the challenges for research in this field has been how best 
  to handle the scale dependency of these data. Most topographic properties are dependent on the scale at which they are 
  measured. Consider local topographic position, which measures how elevated or low lying a site is relative to its 
  surroundings. This property affects soils development because low-lying sites accumulate materials, and therefore tend to 
  exhibit deeper soils than elevated sites. However, at what spatial scale, or scales, should topographic position be measured 
  to best represent this soil-forming process and to serve as a predictor for soil distribution models? Research has shown 
  that using a set of topographic predictors measured at a range of scales can improve model performance. However, this 
  multi-scale approach can add to model complexity. Recent research has offered an alternative approach for multi-scale analysis, 
  in which the most important scales for representing a topographic property are identified for each individual location based 
  on the unique properties of a site and its surroundings. This method involves creating a <em>scale mosaic</em> from a stack of 
  scaled maps that retains much of the information contained within the full stack. <strong>This research aims to explore the 
  opportunties for scale mosaics of topographic data sets for improving landscape modelling and to advance current methods for 
  identifying characteristic scales.</strong></p>

<p class="bodyText"><strong>I aim to advise one Masters and one PhD student in the Fall of 2024</strong> (a Winter 2024 start is also possible) to carry out a geomorphometry
  related research projects focussed on mult-scale geomorphometry. The successful students <strong>must be Canadian citizens or 
  permanent residents</strong> (I only have sufficient research funding to support domestic students currently). If you are interested in research in this area please contact 
  me. The incoming students will join the vibrant Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group (GHRG) at the 
  <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/">University of Guelph</a>, have opportunities to work on open-source GIS development
  (WhiteboxTools), and will have excellent employment opportunties upon graduation in Canada's growing geomatics sector.

<h2>Undergraduate Opportunities</h2>
<p class="bodyText">Prof. Lindsay is open to advising one or two geography students (majors in EG, GEOG, ERM) during 
  the fall and winter semesters of 2019/20 for <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/current/c12/c12geog.shtml">GEOG*4690 Independent Study projects</a>. 
  If you are interested in GIS, LiDAR remote sensing, and geomorphometry, please come to discuss project ideas.
</p>

<p class="bodyText">The GHRG also hosts a number of undergraduate student volunteers each semester. These students gain valuable 
  experiences analyzing LiDAR and DEM data sets.
