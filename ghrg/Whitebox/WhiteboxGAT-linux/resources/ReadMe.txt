Notes on running Whitebox GAT

1. You must have the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
   Java SE 8u5 or higher installed. It is best to ensure that you are running 
   the 64-bit version, which requires a 64-bit operating system. If the JRE is 
   not currently installed on your computer, visit the Oracle Java website and 
   download the JRE (Standard Edition). Follow the installation instructions.

2. Double-click the WhiteboxGIS.jar file contained in this folder. The program 
   should launch. You will be asked which language you prefer. If nothing 
   happens after double-clicking the JAR then something is likely wrong with 
   your configuration. If you are running Mac OSX, you may have to allow the 
   system to run applications that are not downloaded from the Apple Store. 
   If you are running Linux, you may have to ensure that the execution bit of 
   the JAR file is set. You may also have to configure the system to make JAR 
   files executable from the double-click.

If you have problems running Whitebox GAT, please contact Dr. John Lindsay
