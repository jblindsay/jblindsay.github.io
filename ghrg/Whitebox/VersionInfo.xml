            <Title>Whitebox 3.4.0 Has Been Released</Title>
            <Message><![CDATA[<p>The following additions/modifications have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the first release of Whitebox GAT that includes some plugin tools that 
  are compiled to native code rather than running on the Java Runtime Environment.
  The plan is to develop most tools going forward using natively compiled 
  programming languages and to redevelop some of the existing tools in future
  releases. The native compiled tools in this release have been developed using
  the Rust and Go programming languages. Importantly, this change requires that 
  we now distribute versions of Whitebox that include these tools compiled 
  specifically for Windows, Mac, and Linux OSs.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that falsely reported the use of 32-bit Java on 64-bit computers.</li>
<li>Added an ExportGeoTIFF tool, after many requests. This tool is part of the 
  GoSpatial library. This tool currently only works on MacOS and Linux. Windows
  users need to access the 'whitebox2geotiff' tool directly from the go-spatial
  library, until this is rectified in the next release.</li>
<li>Added new tools for joining (LiDAR Join), segmenting (LiDAR Segment), and 
  separating ground points within LiDAR point clouds. Each tool outputs in LAS 
  format and are native-compiled plugin tools.</li>
<li>Updated and improved the algorithm used by the Remove Off-terrain Objects tool. 
  It is also now a native-complied plugin tool.</li>
<li>Added the LiDAR Elevation Slice tool, which can be used to remove points from
  a LAS file that are above or below specified elevations thresholds. This is a
  native-compiled plugin tool.</li>
<li>Added tools for the mathematical morphology operators Opening and Closing and
  the white top-hat transform.</li>
<li>Added the Isolate Vector Features by Attribute tool.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that removed line feeds when copying code snippets from help 
  documentation into the Scripter.</li>
<li>Updated the RetrieveSRTMDEMData tool to optionally fix ocean elevation values
  by replacing them with nodata.</li>
<li>You can now hillshade raster images by specifying a hillshade source image
  in a raster's display properties. This provides better colour saturation than
  the previous approach of overlaying the raster transparently overtop a 
  hillshade image.</li>
<li>Added the Stream Slope (Continuous) tool in contrast to the Stream Link Slope
  tool.</li>
<li>Updated the save map procedure to include the raster/vector cartographic 
  generalization and the scale type (Standard = 0, Simple = 1, Complex = 2).
<li>Numerous other bug fixes and enhancements.</li>
