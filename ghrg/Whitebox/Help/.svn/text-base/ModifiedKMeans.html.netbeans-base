        <h1>Modified <i>k</i>-means classification</h1>

        <p>This tool is an unsupervised classification method to be applied to 
        multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery. This classification algorithm is 
        very similar to the traditional 
        <a href="kMeansClassification.html"><i>k</i>-Means Classification</a> 
        method and the common ISODATA technique. The main difference between the 
        traditional <i>k</i>-means and this technique is that the user does not 
        need to specify the desired number of classes/clusters prior to running 
        the tool. Instead, the algorithm initializes with a very liberal 
        overestimate of the number of classes and then merges classes that have 
        cluster centres that are separated by less than a user-defined threshold. 
        The main difference between this algorithm and the ISODATA technique is 
        that clusters can not be broken apart into two smaller clusters. This 
        modified <i>k</i>-means algorithm is similar to that described by 
        Mather (2004).</p>
