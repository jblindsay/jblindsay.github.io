                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Currently, points can be categorized as low/high noise, ground, building (roof and facade), power lines, poles, 
                        low/medium/high vegetation, paved surfaces (roads and parking lots), and water.</p><br>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes, running FPC does require a valid license for the software, which you can <a href="purchase.html">purchase 
                        from here</a>. Licenses are perpetual, and a valid license grants you the ability to use FPC for as long as you 
                        operate your computer. In addition to the license, the purchase of a license also comes with a 365-day maintenance & 
                        support term.</p><br>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">+ Are licenses for Flash Point Classifier perpetual?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes, licenses for Flash Point Classifier are perpetual. Once you purchase a license, you can use the software 
                            indefinitely, as long as you comply with the <a href="license.html">terms of the license agreement.</a> You
                            can also transfer your license to another computer if needed, so long as your Maintenance and Support (M&S) 
                            term is valid. M&S terms should be renewed annually to maintain access to software updates and support and 
                            the ability to transfer licenses.</p><br>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>A valid M&S term grants the user the ability to run any updates to the software during the term. It also allows
                            the user to contact WG Inc. (<a href="mailto:contact@wgisoftware.com">contact@wgisoftware.com</a>) with queries
                            about installation and usage of the software. A valid M&S term is also required to transfer your license to another
                            computer. That is, your M&S term grants you the ability to use the floating license model; you may use FPC on any
                            computer but cannot run it on more than one computer simultaneously. When your M&S term expires, you can
                        <a href="purchase.html">purchase a new extended M&S term for your license from here</a>.</p><br>

                    <button class="accordion">+ Do you offer free trials?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes, anyone can <a href="download.html">download</a> the FPC software from our site and start using it for evaluation purposes. Without a valid
                            license, the software will automatically add a random error to the output classified point clouds; the magnitude of
                            error increases each day until you register a license for the software. A message will be issued to the user warning
                            them that they are operating on a trial license and that random error is being added to the output.</p><br>

                    <button class="accordion">+ Can Flash Point Classifier be used to filter out points of certain classes?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes, part of the FPC workflow allows users to selectively remove specified point classes from data sets.</p><br>

                    <button class="accordion">+ Does Flash Point Classifier process multiple input files in parallel?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes, Flash Point Classifier can process multiple input files in parallel, leveraging multi-core processors 
                            to improve performance. Give all those CPU cores some exercise!</p><br>

                    <button class="accordion">+ Can I change the order of a classification workflow?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No, at the moment, is not possible to change the order of individual classifiers in a classification workflow; you
                            can only turn individual classifiers on/off. This is because certain classifiers require that other classifiers have
                            been applied earlier. For example, each of the building, powerline, vegetation, water, and road classifiers require
                            that ground points have already been labelled.</p><br>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>FPC can read LAS and LAZ formats. User may also input e57 point clouds and the software will automatically convert
                            these files into a LAS file, which is then used for classification.</p><br>

                    <button class="accordion">+ What output file formats are supported?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>FPC will write LAS, LAZ and PLY files. For LAS/LAZ file output, the user may specify the version of the LAS
                            specification (*View Application Settings* -> *Default output LAS format*). Output files can optionally contain
                            color data (RGB values) associated with each class category (see *Output Files* -> *Colorize points by class* in
                            the *Classification Workflows* panel). The user may also optionally choose to calculate and associate point normal
                            vectors when the output is a PLY file (see *Output Files* settings in the *Classification Workflows* panel).</p><br>

                        <p>Currently, FPC is available on Microsoft Windows and MacOS. We do not support Linux based operating systems at

                        <p>Registering your license requires Internet access, but once registered, you can use Flash Point Classifier offline.</p><br>

                    <button class="accordion">+ Can Flash Point Classifier be used for classifying ground-based lidar?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>FPC has been designed with airborne lidar, including UAV-based lidar systems and platforms, in mind. While it is
                        possible to apply it to point clouds collected with ground-based lidar systems, it may not work as well on these 
                        data sets.</p><br>
                    </div>

                    <button class="accordion">+ Does Flash Point Classifier use artificial intelligence (AI) in its classifiers?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No, the FPC classifiers do not rely on machine-learning based or pre-trained deep-learning based classifiers.
                            These approaches offer certain advantages in lidar point classification applications, most notably, they have been
                            shown to frequently provide accurate classifications with minimal user intervention required in the way of adjusting
                        parameters. However, this can be viewed as an disadvantage of ML and AI based approach as well. As with all 
                        classification applications, there are times when advanced ML and AI based methods will perform poorly on certain 
                        data sets. Given the black-box nature of these models, it is impossible when this happens to improve the performance 
                        of the classification model because the user does not have the ability to adjust the internal parameters. With FPC, 
                        you can always experiment with adjusting each classifier's parameter values until you find an optimally performing 
                        parameter set. Remember however, all of these classification models, including deep-learning AI models, are imperfect 
                        and some manual classification is sometimes necessary, depending on the application and the accuracy requirements of 
                        the project.</p>
