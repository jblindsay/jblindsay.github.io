    <h1>Trend Surface</h1>
    <p>This tool can be used to interpolate a trend surface from a raster image.
      The technique uses a polynomial, least-squares regression analysis. The
      user must specify the name of the input raster file. In addition, the user
      must specify the polynomial order (0 to 10) for the analysis. A
      first-order polynomial is a planar surface with no curvature. As the
      polynomial order is increased, greater flexibility is allowed in the
      fitted surface. Although polynomial orders as high as 10 are accepted,
      numerical instability in the analysis often creates artifacts in trend
      surfaces of orders greater than 5. The operation will display a text
      report on completion, in addition to the output raster image. The report
      will list each of the coefficient values and the r-square value. Note that
      the entire raster image must be able to fit into computer memory, limiting
      the use of this tool to relatively small rasters. The <a href="TrendSurfaceVectorPoints.html"><em><strong>Trend
      Surface (Vector Points)</strong></em></a> tool can be used instead
      if the input data is vector points contained in a shapefile.</p>
