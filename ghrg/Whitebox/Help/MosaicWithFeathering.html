        <h1>Mosaic with feathering</h1>

        <p>This tool will create a mosaic from two input images. It is similar in 
            operation to the <a href="Mosaic.html"><b><i>Mosaic</i></b></a> tool, 
            however, this tool is the preferred method of mosaicing images when there is 
            significant overlap between the images. For areas of overlap, the feathering 
            method will calculate the output value as a weighted combination of the two 
            input values, where the weights are derived from the squared distance of the 
            pixel to the edge of the data in each of the input raster files. Therefore, 
            less weight is assigned to an image's pixel value where the pixel is very near 
            the edge of the image. Note that the distance is actually calculated to the 
            edge of the data and not the edge of the grid, taking into account the fact that 
            rectified images often contain areas of <b><i>NoData</i></b> values near grid 
            edges if the data are rotated. The result of this feathering method is that 
            the output mosaic image should have very little evidence of the original image 
            edges within the overlapping area. Histogram matching can also be performed 
            on one of the input images (i.e. the 'Append' image) to force its radiometric 
            properties (contrast) to match that of the 'Base' image. If this option is 
            selected, the user should specify the name of the image with the superior 
            contrast characteristics as the 'Base' image. If histogram matching is not used, 
            there is no difference between either of the two input images. Note that this 
            tool will create several temporary images, which should be automatically 
            deleted upon completion.</p>

        <p>Unlike the <a href="Mosaic.html"><b><i>Mosaic</i></b></a> tool, which can take 
            multiple input images, this tool only accepts two input images. 
            <b><i>Mosaic</i></b> is therefore useful when there are many, adjacent or 
            only slightly overlapping images, e.g. for data sets of interpolated LiDAR 
            DEM tiles.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                baseFile = wd + "input1.dep"<br>
                appendFile = wd + "input2.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                resamplingMethod = "nearest neighbour"<br>
                matchHistograms = "true"<br>
                args = [baseFile, appendFile, outputFile, resamplingMethod, matchHistograms]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("MosaicWithFeathering", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def baseFile = wd + "input1.dep"<br>
                def appendFile = wd + "input2.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                def resamplingMethod = "nearest neighbour"<br>
                def matchHistograms = "true"<br>
                String[] args = [baseFile, appendFile, outputFile, resamplingMethod, matchHistograms]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("MosaicWithFeathering", args, false)<br>
