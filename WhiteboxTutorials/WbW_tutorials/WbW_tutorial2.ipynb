    "Many of the LSPs calculated above are scale dependent and require us to specify a measurement scale, usually in the form of a `filter_size` parameter. This parameter allows us to calculate these parameters at a single, uniform spatial scale. For many LSPs, Whitebox also allows us to calculate *scale mosiacs*. An LSP scale mosaic are calculated by estimating the normalized value of the LSP across a range of spatial scales, known as a scale space or stack, and then to identify the scale at which each grid cell is most expressive. This is known as the characteristic scale or key scale and it can be different for different locations. An LSP scale mosaic therefore represents the value of that LSP at the key scale of each individual grid cell. In comparison to the uniform scale approach, scale mosaics provide locally scale optimized representations of the LSP being measured. \n",

    "The multiscale topographic position (MSTP) image is really only meant for visualization purposes, but can be very effective for interpreting landscapes. In effect, with a MSTP image, you are using colour to represent spatial scales. Pixels that are blue are most deviated (either elevated or low-lying) at the local scale, green pixels are most deviated at the intermediate scale, and redish pixels are most deviated at the broadest tested scale range. Of course, you can also have combinations therein, e.g. a yellow pixel is one that is deviated at the intermediate and broad scales, but not particularly deviated at the local scale.\n",

    "Whitebox contains functions for calculating other multiscale LSPs as well, including `multiscale_elevation_percentile`, `multiscale_roughness`, `multiscale_std_dev_normals`, `max_anisotropy_dev`, `gaussian_scale_space`, and `multiscale_curvatures`. Below we use the `multiscale_curvatures` function (requires a WbW-Pro license) to estimate a multiscale version of mean curvature. Compare this output with that of the `mean_curv.tif` raster generated previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice that in addition to the scale mosaic, each of the multiscale LSP functions also output a second raster for the key scales (i.e. the characteristic scale at which the 'optimal' LSP value is calculated). You may wish to display some of our generated key scale rasters and explore the information contained within these ancillary rasters."
