        <h1>Find tie points</h1>

        <p>This tool locates matching points between two overlapping images using the Speeded Up Robust 
        Features (SURF) algorithm (Bay et al., 2008). The SURF algorithm identifies key pixels in an image 
        that are likely to remain identifiable after various radiometric and geometric distortions. The 
        matched points that are identified using this tool can later be used as inputs to an 
        <a href="ImageRectification.html"><b><i>image-to-image registration</i></b></a> operation.</p>
        
        <p>The SURF parameters include a threshold value, the number of octaves, and a matching threshold. 
        A lower SURF threshold value will result in a greater number of SURF points located in each 
        of the two images and vice versa. The number of identified points is relatively insensitive 
        to the number of octaves and the default value of 4 is a reasonable value for most image pairs. 
        The matching threshold is used during the SURF point matching process (i.e. the process of 
        finding potential pairs of corresponding points between the left and right images). It is used 
        to determine whether two SURF points are similar enough in character to be considered 
        corresponding points. The matching process operates as follows. Each SURF point in the left 
        image is selected. The Euclidean distance in attribute-space is calculated between the 
        left-image point and each right-image SURF point. When the Euclidean distance of the best 
        fitting pair (i.e. smallest attribute distance between left-image/right-image points) divided 
        by the distance the second best fitting pair is less than the matching threshold, the pair are 
        considered to be a left/right-correspondence. Thus, a lower matching threshold 
        applies a more rigorous matching criteria, resulting in fewer corresponding points located, and 
        vice versa.</p>

        <p>While the above process locates potential corresponding points between the left and right 
        images based on their SURF attributes, there is still potential that this matched point set 
        will contain outliers that are not true corresponding points. To help remove these outlier 
        points, the algorithm calculates a two-dimensional polynomial rectification transformation 
        model, which provides the spatial mapping of the one image's SURF points onto the second image's 
        points. Point matches that are not true correspondences will be apparent in this transformation 
        model as outliers. The user can select the polynomial order of the transformation model and the 
        maximum allowable error value (in pixels), which determines which point matches are removed. 
        Notice that, 1) a polynomial order of more than 2 is not generally advisable, and 2) this 
        method for removing outlier matching points does not work well where there is extensive 
        topographic relief or off-terrain objects (e.g. buildings) in the scene.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>

            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>

                rightinputFile = wd + "rightImage.dep"<br>
                leftOutputFile = wd + "leftPoints.shp"<br>
