<h1>Minimum convex hull</h1>

<p>This tool calculates the minimum convex hull, or the minimum convex polygon containing all of the 
points within a set of vector features. The vector features can be a group of points, polylines, or 
polygons. A polygon is convex if the straight line connecting each pair of points within the polygon is 
itself wholely contained within the polygon, i.e. the boundary of the polygon doesn't possess any inlets or 
bays.</p>
<p>If the input vector file contains polylines or polygons, the user can optionally choose to have 
the convex hull defined for individual features or the entire group of features. Vectors containing points 
can only have convex hulls defined for the set of points and not individual points.</p>
