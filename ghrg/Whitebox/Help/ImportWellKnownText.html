        <h1>Import well-known text (WKT)</h1>
        <div>This tool can be used to import a 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">Well-Known 
                Text (WKT)</a> file to a vector shapefile. WKT is a text based mark-up 
        format that is commonly used to store geographical data, and particularly 
        vector features. It is widely used for data exchange among GIS programs. 
        The WKT reader in Whitebox relies on the Java Topology Suite (JTS).</div> 
        <div>One of the limitations of the shapefile format is that it can only store 
        geometries of one type, i.e. all the records in a file must be of the same 
        ShapeType. This is not the case for the WKT format. As such, at present, 
        only WKT files containing geometries of a singular type (e.g. all records 
        are Points, LineStrings, or Polygons) can be imported with this tool.</div>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                # You may have multiple input files but they must<br>
                # be separated by semicolons in the string.<br>
                inputFiles = wd + "input1.wkt" + ";" + wd + "input2.wkt" + ";" + wd + "input3.wkt"<br>
                args = [inputFiles]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ImportWellKnownText", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                // You may have multiple input files but they must<br>
                // be separated by semicolons in the string.<br>
                def inputFiles = wd + "input1.wkt" + ";" + wd + "input2.wkt" + ";" + wd + "input3.wkt"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFiles]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ImportWellKnownText", args, false)<br>
            </code>
