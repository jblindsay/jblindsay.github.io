    "Decreasing the value of `channel_threshold` will result in a more extensive network of stream channels and increasing it will result in a less extensive network. The channel threshold of 25000 (in grid cells) has been selected simply by examining the values of flow accumulation within the `qin_flow_accum.tif` file near the headwaters of the visible stream channels in the hillshade image. There will, of course, be variation in this value and it may require some refining to get a reasonable value that performs well throughout. In fact, geomorphologists often use more sophisticated methods, usually involving slope and sometimes other factors, to select a channelization threshold. Experiment with the value of `channel_threshold` to see how the stream network is impacted by this value.\n",
