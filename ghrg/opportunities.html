      <h1>Postdoctoral Fellow/Research Associate – Geomorphometry (Digital Terrain Analysis)</h1>
        <p class="bodyText">
The Department of Geography, Environment, and Geomatics at University of Guelph is seeking a postdoctoral 
fellow/research associate to join the Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group (GHRG) led by Dr. 
John Lindsay (in collaboration with Drs. Berg and Yang). The research team members, comprising graduate 
and undergraduate research students, have versatile expertise in the fields of geomorphometry (i.e., the 
quantitative analysis of digital elevation data), LiDAR remote sensing, and spatial analysis applied to 
hydrological and geomorphological research problems. As active members in the open-source GIS development 
community, the GHRG is home to the WhiteboxTools and Whitebox GAT software.  </p>

<p class="bodyText">
The successful candidate is expected to play an important role in lab-related research projects, including 
a large research study focused on predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) within southwestern Ontario’s 
agricultural lands using LiDAR-derived terrain data. S/he should: 1) have a research background that 
includes spatial analysis (GIS), remote sensing, LiDAR, and/or geomorphometry, 2) be familiar with 
commonly used GIS tools (e.g. ArcGIS, QGIS, Whitebox GAT, WhiteboxTools), and 3) have hands-on experience 
with GIS development and related programming languages. Demonstrated computer programming skills are 
necessary, with preferred experience using one or more of the Python, C/C++, Java, or Rust programming 
languages. The position may be filled as either a postdoctoral fellow or a research associate. For the 
postdoctoral fellow, a Ph.D. degree is required at the time of appointment, whereas, the excellent 
candidates holding a master degree will be considered for hire as a research associate. This is a 
full-time, grant-funded research position for one year with possible renewal upon fund availability and 
a satisfactory performance.  </p>

<p class="bodyText">
The screening process will start from September 1, 2019 and continue until the position is filled. 
Applicants should submit a curriculum vita, a one-page statement of research philosophy and interest, and 
the contact information of three referees, to:
