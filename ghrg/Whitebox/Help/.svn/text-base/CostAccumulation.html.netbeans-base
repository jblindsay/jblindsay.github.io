<h1>Cost accumulation</h1>

<p>The <b><i>cost-accumulation</i></b> tool can be used to perform <a
href="LeastCostAnalysis.html">cost-distance or least-cost pathway</a> analyses.
Specifically, this tool can be used to calculate the accumulated cost of
travelling from the 'source grid cell' to each other grid cell in a raster
dataset. It is based on the costs associated with travelling through each cell
along a pathway represented in a cost (or friction) surface. If there are
multiple source grid cells, each cell in the resulting cost-accumulation
surface will reflect the accumulated cost to the source cell that is connected
by the minimum accumulated cost-path. The user must specify the names of the
raster file containing the source cells (<b><i>Input Source Raster</i></b>),
the raster file containing the cost surface information (<b><i>Input
Cost-Friction Raster</i></b>), the output <b><i>Cost-accumulation Surface
Raster</i></b>, and the output <b><i>Back-Link Raster</i></b>. Source cells are
designated as all positive, non-zero valued grid cells in the <b><i>Source
Raster</i></b>. The <b><i>Cost (Friction) Raster</i></b> can be created by
combining the various cost factors associated with the specific problem (e.g.
slope gradient, visibility, etc.) using the raster calculator or the <b><i><a
href="WeightedOverlay.html">Weighted Overlay</a></i></b> tool. While the
<b><i>Cost-accumulation Surface Raster</i></b> can be helpful for visualizing
the three-dimensional characteristics of the 'cost landscape', it is actually
the <b><i>Back-Link Raster </i></b>that is used as inputs to the other two
cost-distance tools, <b><i>Cost Allocation</i></b> and <b><i>Cost
Pathway</i></b>, to determine the least-cost linkages among neighbouring grid
cells on the cost surface. If the accumulated cost surface is analagous to a
digital elevation model (DEM) then the <b><i>Back-Link Raster</i></b> is
equivalent to the <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 flow-direction</a> pointer.
In fact, it is created in exactly the same way and uses the same convention for
designating 'flow directions' between neighbouring grid cells. </p>

<p>The cost of moving through a cell will be considered to be directionally
invariant (i.e. isotropic; it is the same cost to travel northward through a
cell as it is to travel eastward) if the user does not specify values for
either the anisotropic direction or strength. An anisotropic bias can be added
to the process of calculating the outputs by specifying an anisotropic
direction (a number between 0 and 360 degrees) and an anisotropic strength (a
number between -100 and 100).</p>

<p>The two input grids must have the same dimensions. The algorithm operates in
an interative manner. Depending on the size of the input grids and the
complexity of the cost surface, the tool may take considerable time to
complete. <b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the input cost surface image are
ignored during processing and assigned <i><b>NoData</b></i> values in the
ouputs. The output cost accumulation raster is of the <i>float</i> data type
and <i>continuous</i> data scale. The ouput back-link raster is of the
<i>integer</i> data type and the <i>continous</i> data scale.</p>
