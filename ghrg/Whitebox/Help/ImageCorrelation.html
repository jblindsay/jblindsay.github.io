        <h1>Image correlation</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to estimate the Pearson product-moment correlation
            coefficient (<i>r</i>) between two images. The <i>r</i>-value is a measure of
            the linear association in the variation of the input variables (images, in this
            case). The coefficient ranges from -1, indicated a perfect negative linear
            association, to 1, indicated a perfect positive linear association. An
            <i>r</i>-value of 0 indicates no correlation between the test variables. </p>

        <p>Note that this index is a measure of the <i>linear</i> association; two
            variables may be strongly related by a non-linear association (e.g. a power
            function curve) which will lead to an apparent weak association based on the
            Pearson coefficient. In fact, non-linear associations are very common among
            spatial variables, e.g. terrain indices such as slope and contributing area. In
            such cases, it is advisable that the input images are transformed prior to the
            estimation of the Pearson coefficient, or that an alternative, non-parametric
            statistic be used, e.g. the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. </p>

        <p>The user must specify the names of two or more input images. All input
            images must share the same grid, as the coefficient requires a comparison of a
            pair of images on a grid-cell-by-grid-cell basis. If more than two image names
            are selected, the correlation coefficient will be calculated for each pair of
            images and reported in the text output as a correlation matrix. Caution must be
            exercised when attempted to estimate the significance of a correlation
            coefficient derived from image data. The remarkably high <i>N</i>-value
            (essentially the number of pixels in the image pair) means that even small
            correlation coefficients can be found to be statistically significant, despite
            being practically insignificant.</p>

        <p><b><i>NoData</i></b> values in either of the two input images are ignored
            during the calculation of the correlation between images.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                # You may have multiple input files but they must<br>
                # be separated by semicolons in the string.<br>
                inputFiles = wd + "input1.dep" + ";" + wd + "input2.dep" + ";" + wd + "input3.dep"<br>
                args = [inputFiles]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ImageCorrelation", args, False)<br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                // You may have multiple input files but they must<br>
                // be separated by semicolons in the string.<br>
                def inputFiles = wd + "input1.dep" + ";" + wd + "input2.dep" + ";" + wd + "input3.dep"<br>
                String[] args = [inputFiles]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("ImageCorrelation", args, false)<br>
            </code>
