<h1>Image regression</h1>

<p>This tool performs a bivariate linear regression analysis on two input raster images. The first image is 
considered to be the independent variable while the second image is considered to be the dependent variable 
in the analysis. The tool will output a text report summarizing the regression model, an Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA), and the significance of the regression coefficients. The regression residuals can optionally be 
output as a new raster image and the user can also optionally specify to standardize the residuals.</p>

<p>Note that the analysis performs a <i>linear</i> regression; two variables may be strongly related by a 
non-linear association (e.g. a power function curve) which will lead to an apparently weak fitting 
regression model. In fact, non-linear relations are very common among spatial variables, e.g. terrain 
indices such as slope and contributing area. In such cases, it is advisable that the input images are 
transformed prior to the analysis.</p>
