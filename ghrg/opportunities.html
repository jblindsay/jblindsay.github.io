<h1>Opportunities in the GHRG</h1>

<h2>Masters opportunity researching the topographic controls on specialty crop distributions</h2>
<p class="bodyText">Agricultural production is controlled by numerous environmental factors, 
  including climate, soils, hydrology, and topography. Prof. John Lindsay, at the University of 
  Guelph’s Department of Geography, Environment & Geomatics, is seeking an MSc student, commencing 
  Fall 2021, who will examine topographic controls on food production. Specifically, the successful 
  applicant will join a research project focused on characterizing the topographic factors 
  controlling the spatial patterns of specialty crops (e.g., apples, peaches, grapes, carrots, onions, 
  sweet peppers, cucumbers, and ginseng) in Southern Ontario. This work is part of a larger effort to 
  model the impact of climate change scenarios on Ontario agricultural production. An understanding of 
  the analysis of digital elevation model (DEM) data sets (i.e., geomorphometry) is highly beneficial, 
  as is familiarity with GIS, remote sensing, and statistics. Candidates should also have experience 
  with, or be willing to learn, basic computer programming and machine learning approaches to data 
  analysis. The student will join the Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group, home to the 
  open-source WhiteboxTools GIS. For more information about this opportunity please contact Prof. 
  Lindsay at jlindsay@uoguelph.ca. Information about the application process can be found on the 
  Guelph Geography webpage. The student will receive financial support following the policy in the 
  Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics.
</p>

<h2>Graduate Opportunities</h2>
<p class="bodyText">I will aim to take on a masters student in the Fall of 2020 to carry out a geomorphometry
  related research project. If you are interested in geomorphometry, LiDAR remote sensing, digital elevation 
  models (DEMs), and/or open-source geomatics software development please contact me.

<h2>Undergraduate Opportunities</h2>
<p class="bodyText">Prof. Lindsay is open to advising one or two geography students (majors in EG, GEOG, ERM) during 
  the fall and winter semesters of 2019/20 for <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/current/c12/c12geog.shtml">GEOG*4690 Independent Study projects</a>. 
  If you are interested in GIS, LiDAR remote sensing, and geomorphometry, please come to discuss project ideas.
</p>

<p class="bodyText">The GHRG also hosts a number of undergraduate student volunteers each semester. These students gain valuable 
  experiences analyzing LiDAR and DEM data sets.
