        <h1>Stochastic depression analysis</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to map topographic depressions in a digital 
            elevation model (DEM), taking into account the uncertainty in 
            depression shape resulting from DEM error. The tool uses a stochastic 
            simulation approach (i.e. Monte Carlo method) to map depressions. It 
            is a re-implementation of the algorithm described by Lindsay and 
            Creed (2006), originally appearing in the Terrain Analysis System 
            (TAS) software. Whitebox's stochastic depression analysis tool 
            contains several improvements compared to the earlier TAS algorithm. 
        </p>

        <p>The Whitebox algorithm differs in the way that each realization, and 
            in particular the error fields, are created. It uses a 
            <a href="TurningBands.html">turning bands</a> technique to create 
            error fields. The turning bands method is used to ensure that the 
            error fields have the desired spatial characteristics (e.g. 
            autocorrelation and range) and <a href="HistogramMatching.html">
                Histogram Matching</a> is used to ensure they have the 
            appropriate statistical distribution.</p> 

        <p>By using histogram matching, the modelled DEM error can follow any 
            desirable statistical distribution. For example, it is commonly the 
            case that error within a DEM is more peaked than would be described 
            by a Guassian (normal) distribution. The user specifies the shape of 
            the error distribution by inputing a histogram. This is simply a 
            text file with two columns, the first is error value (in the same 
            units as the z-units of the DEM) and the second is the frequency of 
            occurrence (for additional information see 
            <a href="HistogramMatching.html"><b><i>Histogram Matching</i></b></a>). 
            This can be generated in a spreadsheet for theoretical 
            distributions (e.g. if the only error information that is available 
            is an RMSE value derived from the DEM's metadata, then it is 
            reasonable to assume a Gaussian distribution and to create the 
            appropriate histogram using the Gaussian probability function in a 
            spreadsheet). The preferred method for generating the input error 
            histogram, however, is to use ground control points (GCPs). If  
            several GCPs are available, it is possible to derive an empirical 
            error distribution form the data, again using a spreadsheet to plot 
            the frequency distribution.</p>

        <p>The added benefit of having GCPs is that it these same data can also 
            be used calculate the range, which is a measure of the correlation 
            length within the error fields. This value must be specified, in 
            the same units as the DEM x-y units. If GCPs are available, the range 
            can be derived from the variogram. In this way, it is possible to 
            ensure that each DEM realization in the simulation has the appropriate 
            spatial and statistical error properties.</p>

        <p>The tool effectively creates a user specified number of DEM 
            realizations, i.e. multiple equiprobable models of the topography 
            given the known error characteristics. Each realization is created 
            by adding a unique error field to the original DEM. The topographic 
            depressions within the DEM realization are then mapped by differencing 
            a depression-filled version of the realization from the non-depression 
            filled realization. Depressions are filled using the highly efficient 
            <a href="FillDepressions.html">Wang and Liu (2006) depression filling</a> 
            algorithm. The use of this algorithm does limit the application of 
            this tool to DEMs that fit in memory. With each iteration, grid cells 
            that are affected by the depression filling process are flagged and 
            entered into a cumulative grid. In this way, the probability of a 
            grid cell belonging to a depression feature (<i>p<sub>dep</sub></i>), 
            given the uncertainty in the DEM, can be mapped. The simulation will 
            continue until the user-specified number of iterations has been 
            reached. This stochastic analysis has been found to provide 
            accurate maps of depressions (or wetlands, in some landscapes) even 
            with moderate resolution DEM data. The accuracy of the results will 
            depend, however, on the specific DEM data and the landscape 
            characteristics.</p>
