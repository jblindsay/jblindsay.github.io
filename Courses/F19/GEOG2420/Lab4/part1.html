<p><em>Warning, the data that are used in this lab are quite large. Do not try to run this lab on your personal
laptop if it does not have sufficient memory, available hard drive space, and processing power. For example,
it is unlikely that a MacBook Air would be sufficiently capable to perform the analyses carried out in this
lab exercise. If you find yourself in this situation, use the workstations in the undergraduate computing
lab instead.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, you must decompress (i.e. unzip) the lab data files before you can carry out the lab.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>QGIS is a wonderful software package for visualizing other types of remotely sensed data, such as satellite images, but it isn't particularly useful for visualizing 3D point clouds like LiDAR data. For that, we need a different kind of software. Open a web browser and visit the website <a href="http://plas.io/">http://plas.io</a>. This is a browser-based application for viewing LiDAR data that are stored in <a href="http://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LAS_1_4_r14.pdf">LAS files</a> (*.las). Press the <strong>Browse</strong> button at the top of the side panel and select the <strong>1km174790476002017.las</strong> from your lab data directory (see note above about ensuring this directory is unzipped). This data set is a 1 km<sup>2</sup> tile taken from the 2017-2018 Lake Erie LiDAR data set. It is situated within the heart of the City of London, Ontario and was collected during the spring of 2017, before the leaves were on the trees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now would be a good time for you to watch the NEON Science video on LiDAR listed in the <a href="./intro.html"><strong>Readings and Resources</strong></a> section of the Introduction, if you haven't already done so.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you scroll further down the side panel, you will see that <em>plas.io</em> has defaulted to the RGB values for the <strong>Colorization</strong> and sets the <strong>Intensity Blending</strong> to 100% (&quot;ALL INTENSITY&quot;). For each return (backscattered point) of a LiDAR laser pulse, in addition to to recording the x,y,z coordinates of the backscattered point the system also records the intensity of the return. These intensity values are what are being rendered for the 3D point cloud at present. Adjust the Intensity Blending scrollbar to 0% (i.e. &quot;ALL COLOR&quot;). You'll notice that the point cloud disappears. This is because the colour data used to render the point cloud is currently being drawn from the RGB colours associated with each point. While LiDAR systems do not capture any colour information for the point measurements they make, it is common for LiDAR surveys to collect a set of air photos at the same time and these data are often used to associate RGB colours with each point. In the case of this particular data set, this was not done at the time of collection and so there are no RGB values stored with the points (thus they are being rendered black, like the background).</p>
<p>Select &quot;Heightmap Color&quot; under the <strong>Colorization</strong> drop-down menu. Each point will now be coloured based on elevation rather than RGB. You may experiment with different colour palettes (I prefer the one second from the right), and with the colourization scroll bar to adjust the minimum and maximum palette scaling, until you are satisfied with your rendering. Now minimize the side panel and experiment with zooming into and moving around the point cloud. <em>Caution, this is a very large data file and rendering in 3D can be a computationally expensive operation. See the warning at the top of the page about using an appropriate computer to complete this lab. If your laptop does not have an adequate graphics card, your ability to navigate the point cloud will be severely compromised and you may even crash your system.</em></p>

<p>1.1. Provide a screenshot of your rendered 3D point cloud. Also, describe the site characteristics in detail.

</blockquote>
<p>Using the WhiteboxTools plugin for QGIS, use the <a href="https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/lidar_tools.html#LidarInfo"><strong>LidarInfo</strong></a> to display the metadata for this LiDAR tile. The output of this analysis is an HTML report, which should be displayed in an opened browser tab automatically after completion. If this report does not automatically open, simply double-click the file that has been saved into your lab data directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.2. What is the total number of points contained in the LAS file? What are the minimum and maximum elevations (z-values) of the points? (3 marks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of particular interest to us are the three <strong>Point Returns Analysis</strong> tables (i.e. the <em>Point Return Table</em>, <em>Point Position Table</em>, and <em>Point Classification Table</em>). A LiDAR system emits many thousands of laser pulses every second. Most of those pulses never make it back to the sensor, but some of them will reflect off of objects below the aircraft and be backscattered towards the sensor and are recorded as a point. By the time the laser makes it to the ground, it has an appreciable size (i.e. it's not the tiny dot that you would recognize as a laser pointer). That laser &quot;footprint&quot; has the potential to intersect and bounce off of multiple surfaces. Thus, each <em>pulse</em> of the laser may be associated with one or more <em>return points</em>. The LiDAR system used to collect these data was capable of recording up to five separate returns for each pulse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.3. What proportion of the points have a return number of either 1 or 2? (1 mark)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The return number information is interesting, however, really it is the information on the return position that is most useful. This tells us about the position of a point relative to other points that were backscattered from the same pulse. Because ALS data are collected with an overhead perspective, returns that are backscattered after others must be closer to the ground. Also, vegetation is very often the land cover that is most associated with multiple returns per pulse. The options for return position include:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Only' (i.e. there was only one return for the pulse),</li>
<li>'First' (i.e. the first of a multi-return group of points),</li>
<li>'Intermediate' (i.e. neither the first nor last in a return group for a pulse), and;</li>
<li>'Last' (i.e. the last return of a multi-return set).</li>
</ul>
<p>We can confidently know that all first and intermediate return points have been reflected off of objects sitting above the ground. The points that are on the ground surface are a subset of the only and last return points. Some of the only-returns may be the roofs of buildings (where the laser footprint is not split between multiple surfaces) and some of the last-returns may be nearer the ground than their earlier-return cousins, but they also have been reflected off of low vegetation or tree trunks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.4. What proportion of the LiDAR points were last and only returns? (1 mark)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LAS files may store up to 22 different class types, corresponding to land-cover categories, for each point. You will notice that this file only contains five class values, the largest of which is <em>Unclassified</em>, meaning that no class value was ever assigned. Two of the point class values, <em>Low point</em> and <em>High noise</em>, represent points that are situated anomalously below or above the bulk of the data. These are often data errors and result either from measurement error, birds (high noise), or the mis-calculation of the point's x-y position (perhaps due to a double-bounce). Use <em>plas.io</em> to see if you can find these points sitting below the surface or high above the rest of the point cloud. These data are problematic for other types of analysis. Use the <a href="https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/lidar_tools.html#FilterLidarClasses"><strong>FilterLidarClasses</strong></a> tool, located within WhiteboxTools' <em>LiDAR Tools</em> toolbox, to remove low points (class 7) and high noise (class 18) from the point cloud. Call the output LAS file <strong>1km174790476002017_filtered.las</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.5. Demonstrate the effectiveness of filtering the outlier points in the original data set by providing before-and-after screenshots (this is particularly obvious easy to do for the low-lying points since they sit well below the ground surface/ Also, as always, you probably want to turn the intensity blending down to 0%.). (2 marks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we say above, there was no colour imagery acquired during the time of the LiDAR survey and therefore there is no RGB data available to render. If we have access to a colour air photo of the same site, then we can use this data to provide RGB colour information for our point cloud. Fortunately, the <a href="https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/91e846f08cda4f71825490931b54037a">Southwestern Ontario Orthophotography Project (SWOOP)</a> digital orthophoto data set, which we have described in lecture, provides fine-resolution imagery for this same area of Ontario. In your Lab data folder, you will find a GeoTIFF air photo <strong>1km174790476002010MAPCON.tif</strong> that was collected during the 2010 SWOOP campaign. Conveniently, this photo overlaps completely with the 1 km<sup>2</sup> area covered by our LiDAR data set. Using QGIS, open this GeoTIFF file to get a sense of the data. Now use the <a href="https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/available_tools/lidar_tools.html#LidarColourize"><strong>LidarColourize</strong></a> tool to provide RGB information for each LiDAR point in the filtered LAS file (i.e. <strong>1km174790476002017_filtered.las</strong>). Call the output LAS file <strong>1km174790476002017_colourized.las</strong>. When the tool is complete, open <strong>1km174790476002017_colourized.las</strong> using <em>plas.io</em> and be sure to reduce the intensity blending to 0% (it always defaults to a higher value) and colourize based on the RGB values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.6. Provide a screenshot of your rendered colourized point cloud. What are some of the issues with using this air photo to colourize the LiDAR data? (4 marks)</p>
