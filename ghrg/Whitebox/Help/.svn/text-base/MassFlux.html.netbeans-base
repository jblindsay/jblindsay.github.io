<h1>Mass Flux</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to perform a mass flux calcuation using DEM-based surface flow-routing techniques. For example, it could be used to model the distribution of sediment or phospherous within a catchment. Flow-routing is based on either a <a href="FlowPointerD8.html">D8 flow pointer</a> (i.e. flow direction) raster or a <a href="FlowPointerDinf.html">D-Infinity flow pointer</a>. The user must also specify the names of <b><i>loading</b></i>, <b><i>efficiency</b></i>, and <b><i>absorption</b></i> rasters, as well as the output raster. <b><i>Mass Flux</i></b> operates very much like a <a href="D8FlowAccum.html">flow-accumulation</a> operation except that rather than accumulating catchment areas the algorithm routes a quantity of mass, the spatial distribution of which is specified within the <b><i>loading</b></i> image. The <b><i>efficiency</b></i> and <b><i>absorption</b></i> rasters represent spatial distributions of losses to the accumulation process, the difference being that the <b><i>efficiency</b></i> raster is a proportional loss (e.g. only 50% of material within a particular grid cell will be directed downslope) and the <b><i>absorption</b></i> raster is an loss specified as a quantity in the same units as the loading image. The <b><i>efficiency</b></i> image can range from 0 to 1, or alternatively, can be expressed as a percentage. The equation for determining the mass sent from one grid cell to a neighbouring grid cell is:</p>

<p><b><i>Outflowing Mass = (Loading - Absorption + Inflowing Mass) * Efficiency</i></b></p>
