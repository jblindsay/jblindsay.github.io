<h1>Histogram matching (two images)</h1>

<p>This tool alters the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a raster image to match, as closely as 
possible, the CDF of a reference image. Histogram matching works by first calculating the histograms of the 
input image (i.e. the image to be adjusted) and the reference image. These histograms are then converted into 
CDFs. Each grid cell value in the input image is then mapped to the corresponding value in the reference CDF 
that has the an equivalent (or as close as possible) cumulative probability value. A common application of 
this is to match the images from two sensors with slightly different responses, or images from the same 
sensor, but the sensor's response is known to change over time.</p>

<p>Histogram matching (two images) is related to the <a href="HistogramMatching.html">
<b><i>Histogram Matching</i></b></a> tool, which can be used when a reference CDF is used directly rather 
than deriving it from a reference image. <a href="HistogramEqualization.html"><b><i>Histogram 
Equalization</i></b></a> and <a href="GaussianStretch.html">
<b><i>Gaussian Contrast Stretch</i></b></a> are similarly related tools, where the reference CDFs are 
uniform and Gaussian (normal) respectively.</p>

<p>Notes: 
<ul>
<br><li>The size of the two images (rows and columns) do not need to be the same, nor do they need to be 
geographically overlapping.</li>

<br><li>The algorithm can introduces gaps in the histograms (steps in the CDF). This is to be expected because 
the histograms are being distorted. This is more prevalent for integer-level images.</li>

<br><li>Histogram matching is not appropriate for images containing categorical (class) data. It is also not 
intended for images containing RGB data, in which case, the colour channels should be split using the 
<a href="SplitColourComposite.html"><b><i>Split Colour Composite</i></b></a> tool.</li>
</ul>
