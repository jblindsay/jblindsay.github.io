        <h1>Viewshed</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to calculate the viewshed (i.e. the visible area) from 
            a location (i.e. viewing station) or group of locations based on the topography 
            defined by an input digital elevation model (DEM). The user must specify the 
            name of the input DEM, a viewing station input file, the output file name, and 
            the viewing height. The viewing station input file can be a vector shapefile 
            of a Point base ShapeType (i.e. Point, PointZ, PointM, MultiPoint, MultiPointZ, 
            and MultiPointM), or a raster file. If a raster viewing station raster is 
            specified, viewing station locations will be inferred from all non-zero, 
            non-NoData grid cells. The output image will be a Boolean raster, containing 
            1's and 0's, where 1's imply that the grid cell is visible from at least one 
            viewing station. The viewing height is in the same units as the elevations of 
            the DEM and represent a height above the ground elevation from which the 
            viewshed is calculated. Viewshed analysis is a very computationally 
            intensive task. Depending on the size of the input DEM grid and the number 
            of viewing stations, this operation may take considerable time to complete.</p>
