<h2 id="lab-assignment-5"><a class="header" href="#lab-assignment-5"><strong>Lab Assignment 5</strong></a></h2>
<h2 id="learning-objectives"><a class="header" href="#learning-objectives">Learning objectives</a></h2>
<p>The learning objectives for this lab assignment include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>To learn about the issues related to performing a change detection analysis on multi-date multi-spectral satellite imagery.</li>
<li>To design and implement a small research project, research information on how to address the assigned problem, and to apply a customized solution.</li>
<li>To bring together several of the concepts that you have learned throughout this course in a single assignment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I assume that, at this point in the course, you have a good working knowledge of the <em>Whitebox Workflows</em> and general image processing techniques. Therefore, this final lab is more <em>free-form</em> than the previous assignments. You will be given some background information on what the general topics and requirements are for the lab, but it will be up to you as to how to carry out the analysis. One of the fundamental skills that you will need to take from this course is how to search for and find the information that you need to solve a remote-sensing problem.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you are asked to complete a land-use/land-cover change detection analysis for the nearly 21 years between July 6, 2001 and June 16, 2022. You have been provided with cropped <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-7"><strong>Landsat 7</strong></a> (2001 scene) and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-9"><strong>Landsat 9</strong></a> (2022 scene) imagery for the area of interest on the CourseLink site. These data comprise of the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands of a Landsat 7 (bands 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively) and Landsat 9 (bands 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively). Both image datasets are Level-2 (<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-landsat-archives-landsat-8-olitirs-level-2-data-products?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects"><strong>atmospherically corrected to surface reflectance</strong></a>) scenes (path 18, row 30) that cover part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Hamilton, Guelph, Cambridge, and Kitchener-Waterloo. Note that the image metadata, providing details of the image acquisition, is also distributed along with the imagery. This is the same area (but different images) that we have been using for the lab assignments throughout the semester. As such, you should have a good level of familiarity with the data and the study area. I have provided you with a cropped versions of the original full-scene data set in order to reduce the files to a manageable sizes. I have also performed a percent contrast stretch (PCS) on each band, clipping the lower and upper 0.5% of the image histogram.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you are a remote sensing consultant, hired by me. Don't get too excited, I’m hiring you to work <em>for free</em>! I am an urban planner tasked with developing a plan for Ontario's growing population over the next decade. As such, I am interested in documenting and evaluating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl"><strong>urban expansion</strong></a> that has taken place in the southern Ontario over the recent past, such that I may work with municipalities to plan for the anticipated population growth in their communities. Information about the previous development in the region will allow me to better characterize the capacity for growth in each community. Therefore, I am interested in documenting the recent development in the GTA and surrounding communities and have contracted you, a remote-sensing specialist working for a private consulting company, to aid with documenting urban expansion over the 5-year period between image acquisition dates. I am particularly interested in documenting which areas of the region have experienced the greatest changes (urban expansion into surrounding rural areas) and documenting what type of urban development these past changes have been associated with (e.g. commercial/industrial growth, suburban development, etc.). My primary concern is to document <strong>expansion of residential neighbourhoods</strong>. To answer these questions you will have to perform automated change detection analysis on the provided satellite imagery. It is up to you to research how to go about conducting this analysis but I have provided you with a short list of <a href="./resources.html"><strong>resources</strong></a> to help guide you. You should supplement this list with any additional resources on change detection analysis that you can find during your research, and of course, with the lecture slides on this topic. </p>
<h2 id="things-to-consider"><a class="header" href="#things-to-consider">Things to consider</a></h2>
<p>As you begin your analysis you should note a few things about the data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The scenes are not perfectly cloud free and the 2001 image in particular has several thick clouds (and their associated cloud shadows) in the upper-right corner of the image. This is actually why I cropped the Toronto downtown area out of the raw imagery; it was too heavily clouded for proper analysis. The presence of this cloud cover means that some apparent 'change' may be the difference between cloud/no-cloud between dates. Be aware of this 'uninteresting change' as you interpret your results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imaging sensor of Landsat 7 and the Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) imaging sensor of Landsat 9 differ in significant ways. This is why I only provided you with four corresponding bands (blue, green, red, and NIR) from each raw data set; these are the bands that have equivalents between the two sensors. However, the correspondence is not perfect. You will note, if you click on the Landsat 7 and Landsat 9 info page links above, that the spectral ranges of each corresponding bands are not exactly the same. For example, for Landsat 7 the red band (band 3) has a spectral range from 0.63 - 0.69 µm, while the Landsat 9 red-band (band 4) has a range from 0.64 - 0.67 µm. This small difference will have some minor implications for the change detection, since each band is not detecting precisely the same range of wavelengths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The band designation of the two data sets are offset by one. That is L7 B1 = L9 B2, L7 B2 = L9 B3, etc. This is because Landsat 7 does not have an equivalent to the Landsat 9 band 1 (aerosol).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-hand-in"><a class="header" href="#what-you-need-to-hand-in">What you need to hand in</a></h2>
<p>Prepare a short report of no more than <strong>4 to 5 pages</strong> (not including maps and references) documenting the data and procedure you followed, as well as the results of your analysis. Your final report should include an <strong>introduction</strong>, a brief description of your <strong>methodology</strong>, the <strong>results</strong> of your analyses, a section describing the <strong>limitations</strong> of your methodology, your <strong>recommendations</strong>, and a <strong>references cited</strong> (see the Marking Format, below). Remember, this is a consultant's client report and we are expecting a level of professionalism. <a href="./grading.html"><strong>Marks will be assigned</strong></a> for originality, demonstration of sound remote sensing principles and practice, and innovation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The methodology section of your final report <strong>must include WbW-based Python script(s) that documents your approaches to performing the change detection analysis</strong> and describe any image pre-processing techniques that you used. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="before-you-begin"><a class="header" href="#before-you-begin">Before you begin</a></h2>
<p>You will need to download the data associated with this lab assignment from the GEOG*3420 CourseLink site. These data, as usual, are quite large and you will need to consider data storage solutions (e.g. a dedicated USB memory stick for the course).</p>
