<h1>Extract valleys (Peucker and Douglas)</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to extract channel networks from digital elevation models (DEMs). The Peucker and 
Douglas (1975) algorithm is one of the simplest and earliest algorithms for this purpose. Their 'valley 
recognition' method operates by passing a 2 x 2 roving window over a DEM and flagging the highest grid cell 
in each group of four. Once the window has passed over the entire DEM, channel grid cells are left 
unflagged. This method is best applied to DEMs that are relatively smooth and do not exhibit high levels of 
short-range roughness. As such, it may be desirable to use a 
<a href="FilterGaussian.html">smoothing filter</a> before applying this tool.</p>
<p>This method of extracting valley networks results in line networks that can be wider than a single grid 
cell. As such, it is often desirable to thin the resulting network using a line-thinning algorithm. The 
option to perform line-thinning is provided by the tool as a post-processing step.</p>
