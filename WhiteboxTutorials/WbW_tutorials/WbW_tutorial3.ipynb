Once you register your WbW-Pro license, you will be emailed your unique floating license ID, which will likely be a randomly generated three-word phrase, involving an animal. The license below was used for the *Geomorphometry 2023* conference in Iasi, Romania and will be valid until mid-August 2023. After that point, you will need to purchase a license for WbW-Pro (about 350USD) to use the scripts below.
