        <h1>Directional relief</h1>

        <p>This tool calculates the relief for each grid cell in a digital elevation model 
            (DEM) in a specified direction. <b><i>Directional relief</i></b> is an index 
            of the degree to which a DEM grid cell is higher or lower than its 
            surroundings. It is calculated by subtracting the elevation of a DEM grid 
            cell from the average elevation of those cells which lie between it and the 
            edge of the DEM in a specified compass direction. Thus, positive values 
            indicate that a grid cell is lower than the average elevation of the grid 
            cells in a specific direction (i.e. relatively sheltered), whereas a 
            negative <b><i>directional relief</i></b> indicates that the grid cell is 
            higher (i.e. relatively exposed). The algorithm is based on a modification 
            of the procedure described by Lapen and Martz (1993). The modifications 
            include: (1) the ability to specify any direction between 0-degrees and 
            360-degrees, and (2) the ability to use a distance-limited search, such that 
            the ray-tracing procedure terminates before the DEM edge is reached for 
            longer search paths. The algorithm works by tracing a ray from each grid 
            cell in the direction of interest and evaluating the average elevation 
            along the ray. Linear interpolation is used to estimate the elevation of the 
            surface where a ray does not intersect the DEM grid precisely at one of its 
            nodes. The user must specify the name of an input DEM raster file, the output 
            raster name, and a hypothetical wind direction. Furthermore, the user is able 
            to constrain the maximum search distance for the ray tracing. If no maximum 
            search distance is specified, each ray will be traced to the edge of the DEM. 
            The units of the output image are the same as the input DEM.</p>

        <p>Ray-tracing is a highly computationally intensive task and therefore this tool 
            may take considerable time to operate for larger sized DEMs. 
            <b><i>NoData</i></b> valued grid cells in the input image will be 
            assigned <b><i>NoData</i></b> values in the output image. The output raster 
            is of the <i>float</i> data type and <i>continuous</i> data scale. 
            <b><i>Directional relief</i></b> is best displayed using the blue-white-red 
            bipolar palette to distinguish between the positive and negative values that 
            are present in the output.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a Python script that uses this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                demFile = wd + "DEM.dep"<br>
                outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                azimuth = "215.0"<br>
                maxDist = "5000.0"<br>
                args = [inputFile, outputFile, azimuth, maxDist]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("DirectionalRelief", args, False)<br>

        <p>This is a Groovy script also using this tool:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240)">
            <code>
                def wd = pluginHost.getWorkingDirectory()<br>
                def demFile = wd + "input.dep"<br>
                def outputFile = wd + "output.dep"<br>
                def azimuth = "215.0"<br>
                def maxDist = "not specified"<br>
                String[] args = [demFile, outputFile, azimuth, maxDist]<br>
                pluginHost.runPlugin("DirectionalRelief", args, false)<br>
