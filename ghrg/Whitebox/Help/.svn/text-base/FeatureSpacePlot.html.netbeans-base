        <h1>Feature space plot</h1>

        <p>A <a href="FeatureVectorAndFeatureSpace.html">feature space</a> plot is similar to a scattergram. It plots the frequency of occurrance of brightness 
            value pairs in the two-dimensional feature space of defined by two images. The input images are usually 
            two bands of multispectral imagery, but any two overlapping images with the same dimensions can be used. 
            The higher the frequency of a value pair, the brighter it is represented in the feature space plot. Note 
            that this tool provides a means of visualizing the relation between two raster images, which is often the 
            necessary step before either correlation analysis or regression analysis. The tool is intended to work with 
            images of an integer data type, or with images with a float data type that have a large enough range that 
            they can be rounded to integer values in a meaningful way.</p>
