<h1>Simplify line or polygon</h1>

<p>This uses the Douglas and Peucker (1973) algorithm to simplify vector line or polygon features. The 
tool requires the user to input the name of a vector shapefile of a polyline or polgon shape-type, a 
distance tolerance threshold parameter (measured in the file's x-y units). The user may also opt to ensure 
that no features are lost. Without this option, smaller features that have few nodes distanced closely 
together may be erased from the output shapefile. Note that in general the Douglas and Peucker (1973) 
algorithm does not preserve topology, i.e. polygons can be split, collapse to lines, holes can disappear 
or be created, and lines can cross. The tool uses the line simplification algorithm provided by the Java 
Topology Suite (JTS) library. Line simplification can be computationally intensive and time consuming for 
large and complex vector files.</p>
