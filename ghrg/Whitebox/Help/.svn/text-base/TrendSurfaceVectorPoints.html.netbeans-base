    <h1>Trend Surface (Vector Points)</h1>
    <p>This tool can be used to interpolate a trend surface from a vector points
      file. The technique uses a polynomial, least-squares regression analysis.
      The user must specify the name of the input shapefile, which must be of a
      'Points' base ShapeType and select the attribute in the shapefile's
      associated attribute table for which to base the trend surface analysis.
      The attribute must be numerical. In addition, the user must specify the
      polynomial order (0 to 10) for the analysis. A first-order polynomial is a
      planar surface with no curvature. As the polynomial order is increased,
      greater flexibility is allowed in the fitted surface. Although polynomial
      orders as high as 10 are accepted, numerical instability in the analysis
      often creates artifacts in trend surfaces of orders greater than 5. The
      operation will display a text report on completion, in addition to the
      output raster image. The report will list each of the coefficient values
      and the r-square value. The <a href="TrendSurface.html"><em><strong>Trend
            Surface</strong></em></a> tool can be
      used instead if the input data is a raster image.</p>
