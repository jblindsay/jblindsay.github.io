<p>The scale of an image can be used to relate distances measured on the photo to equivalent ground distances. The <em><strong>photo scale</strong></em> is the ratio of the distance between two points on a photo to the actual distance between the same two points on the ground (i.e. 1 unit on the photo equals "x" units on the ground). It is usually expressed as a Representative Fraction (RF), e.g. 1 / 24,000, or equivalently 1 : 24,000. Notice that to calculate the scale, both the photo distance and the ground distance must be in the same units. Since a representative fraction always has one as the numerator, it is sometimes useful to talk about the <em><strong>Photo Scale Reciprocal</strong></em> (PSR), which is 1 / RF. This a photo with a scale of 1 : 24,000 has a PSR of 24,000.
Given the following geometry:</p>
<p><img src="img/camera_geometry.png" alt="Camera geometry" /></p>
<p>(source: Natural Resources Canada)</p>
<p>It can be determined that the ratio of the footprint of the photo on the ground to the size of the photograph (marked as focal plane in diagram), is equivalent to the ratio of the altitude of the aircraft above the ground level (AGL) to the focal length (<em>f</em>). The focal length of a camera is the distance from the middle of the camera lens to the focal plane (i.e. the film) and it is a very important parameter of a camera. As focal length increases, image distortion decreases, which is one reason why the cameras used in aerial photography tend to have very large focal lengths (e.g. 6 inches to 12 inches). The focal length of a camera used in aerial surveys is measured when the camera is calibrated to a very high level of precision. Now we can state that RF = <em>f</em> / AGL and PSR = AGL / <em>f</em>. When we know the focal length of the camera used to capture an image as well as the flying height (usually we have the ASL and need to subtract the ground elevation, E, to get the AGL) we can easily calculate the photo scale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, often we don't have both the focal length and flying height. In such cases we can calculate the photo scale by measuring the distance between two points in the photo and the corresponding distance on a map (i.e. the ratio of photo distances and ground distances). In applying this method of calculating scale, the two points used for distance calculations should be positioned such that that a line connecting them passes near the principal point (PP), or image centre. They should be approximately equidistant from the PP. Longer distances are preferred, as are lines with relatively flat terrain. The points that you use to measure the distance between should be located on the ground surface and not on any kind of building or other structure. In this way, it is possible to calculate the scale with minimal impact from error due to relief displacement and the effects of image tilt.</p>
<p>The concept of photo scale makes sense for hard-copy aerial photographs, but it is less meaningful for digital, or softcopy, imagery. For example, if you display the same image on a 27 inch monitor and an 18 inch monitor, the image will be at a different scale. Similarly, if you zoom into or out of the image, again the photo scale will change. In this case, the concept of <em><strong>image resolution</strong></em> is more intuitive. Image resolution is the size of a pixel in terms of its ground dimensions. It is usually presented as a single value that represents the length of one side of a square pixel (although rectangular pixels, where the resolution in the horizontal and vertical directions are different, are possible too).</p>
<p>The resolution, like the photo scale, is a measure of the amount of detail contained in an image. It is related to the information content of the image. The finer the resolution (e.g. a 5 m grid compared to a 50 m grid) the greater the detailed captured. Similarly, the larger the photo scale (e.g. RF 1 : 5000 compared to 1 : 100,000) the greater the image detail. (<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: A scale of 1 : 100,000 is smaller than a scale of 1 : 5000 because the number 1/100,000 is smaller than 1/5000).</p>

<p>Open QGIS and display the raster file 'Guelph_A19411-17.tif'. This is a scanned image of a hard copy aerial photograph taken in 1966 of the Guelph area. Importantly, the image is not georeferenced (i.e. it's using a coordinate reference system (CRS) based on the rows and columns called 'Generated CRS (Authority ID USER: 100000)). In fact, the image is not even oriented such that north points upwards. Take some time to orient yourself with the image, looking for familiar landmarks such as the university campus. Notice that the campus was on the outskirts of the city and looked very different than it does today. You can make out the track, Johnston Green, and the Hutt building (built in 1933) are present, but other landmarks like the South residence and University Centre are absent in this old air photo. Guelph has also changed a great deal in the time since this photo was taken, particularly on the south-end. After you have spent some time exploring the image, right-click over the image's entry in the Layers tab and select 'Properties' and click on 'Information'. <em><strong>Please note that stated Units for this photo are currently set as 'Degrees', owing to the user-defined CRS that was assigned to the data. Importantly, the actual horizontal units are 'Pixels'.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1. What are the number of rows (height) and columns (width), and the North, South, East and West coordinates, i.e. extent, of the image? (6 marks)</p>
<p>1.2. Now examine the photo closely. What organization was responsible for the collection of this aerial photograph? (1 mark)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will now calculate the resolution of this image. To do this you will need to measure an image distance, <strong>in degrees</strong> (again, this is actually pixels and not degrees), and the ground distance between the corresponding points on a map. The image resolution is then equal to the ground distance (in meters) divided by the image distance (in pixels). Before you begin, overlay the file PhotoIntersectionMarkers.shp onto the image. QGIS defaults to displaying vector layers with randomly selected colours, which may not show up very well on your map. You may want to therefore modify the symbology of the vector to a more noticeable colour like yellow. Once you have an appropriate symbology, you will see that this file identifies two road intersections; the lower point is the intersection of College Rd. and Victoria Rd. and the upper point is the intersection of Highway 124 and Township Rd. 1. The line connecting these two points passes near the image centre (i.e. the principal point) and traverses a significant length of the overall image width. Use the <strong>Measure Line</strong> tool (the ruler icon on the toolbar; see figure below) to estimate the distance between the two points. Be sure to change the measure to map units, which are in pixels. You will be able to measure a more accurate distance if you zoom closer into the points.</p>
<p><img src="img/distance_measure.png" alt="distance_measure" /></p>
<p>Once you have measured and recorded your photo distance, close all of the open data layers (i.e. the photo and the Shapefile) and add the layers 'GuelphLandsatComposite.tif', 'guelph roads.shp', and 'IntersectionMarkers.shp' to the map view. Notice that the layer 'IntersectionMarkers.shp' depicts the same two road intersection, this time on the properly georeferenced map coordinates. Importantly, notice that these data layers are georeferenced (UTM 17N, with horizontal units in meters). Use the QGIS  <strong>Measure Line</strong> tool to measure the distance between the road intersections in meters (you may need to update the dialog to specify meters). For the map distance, be sure to use the vector road network as your guide for positioning the distance tool at the road intersections, measuring the straight line distance between the intersections. The Landsat image is of a very poor resolution and is only there as a reference aid. Also note that you can zoom into the image to more accurately position the distance tool. The accuracy of your measure will depend on how well you position the cursor and how closely you zoom into the points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.3. What are the image and ground distances between the road intersections? Using these values, calculate the image resolution of the digital photograph? (3 marks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only information that came with the hard copy of this air photo was a handwritten note on the envelope that stated it was taken at a flying height of 20,000 feet (6096 m) above sea level (ASL). The elevation of the ground surface in the image ranges from about 305 m near the river to about 330 m near the university campus, with an average elevation of approximately 320 m. There are many photogrammetric operations that require knowledge of the camera geometry, and specifically the focal length, which unfortunately is unknown. Focal lengths of cameras used for aerial surveys are usually either 6 inches (152.4 mm) or 12 inches (304.8 mm), although their precise focal lengths, which can vary from these theoretical values ever so slightly, are calculated during camera calibration.
In order to calculate the focal length of the camera used to capture this photograph, you will need to know the photo scale of the original image. To calculate the photo scale, you will need to relate a known distance on the original hard-copy photograph to a corresponding ground distance. Although you only have a scanned copy of the original photo, there is a known distance that you can use. Like the vast majority of film-based aerial photography this photograph has been acquired using large-format 9 inch x 9 inch (229 mm x 229 mm) film. Thus, the distance from one edge to the opposing edge on the original air photo is 229 mm. Use your calculation of the image resolution above to estimate what the corresponding ground distance is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.4. What is the scale of the original aerial photograph, expressed as a representative fraction? Be sure to show your work. (3 marks)</p>
<p>1.5. Given the flying height, the average ground elevation, the calculated photo scale, and the relation between these things and focal length (described above), calculate the focal length (in mm) of the camera. (2 marks)</p>
<p>1.6. Based on your calculated focal length and your knowledge of the common focal lengths of cameras used in aerial surveys, how accurate do you think that the flying height noted on the photos envelope was? (2 marks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close all open layers from the previous sections of the lab. Now add the photograph named 'GuelphCampus254.tif' to the map view. This is a photo of a section of the university campus. You'll notice based on one of the gauges on the right-hand side of the photo that the calibrated focal length of the camera used to acquire this image is 152.420 mm. Also, the aircraft altitude was 6855 ft. Remember the average ground elevation is 330 m near the university campus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.7. Using the relationships between <em>f</em> and AGL described in the <a href="./part1.html">background material</a>, calculate the photo scale Reciprocal (PSR) and photograph scale (expressed as a representative fraction) of the 'GuelphCampus254.tif' photo. Be sure to show your work, including unit conversions. (4 marks)</p>
<p>1.8. Which of the two air photos, 'Guelph_A19411-17.tif' or 'GuelphCampus254.tif', has the larger scale? (1 mark)</p>
<p>1.9. What time of day was the 'GuelphCampus254.tif' photo taken during? (2 marks)</p>
<p>1.10. Provide four examples of changes that have occurred since the time the 'GuelphCampus254.tif' photo was taken. (4 marks)</p>
