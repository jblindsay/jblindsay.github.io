        <h1>Inverse principal component analysis</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to perform an inverse principal component 
            analysis (PCA) on a set of PCA component images. The component 
            images must have been created using the 
            <a href="PrincipalComponentAnalysis.html"><b><i>Principal Component 
                        Analysis</i></b></a> tool. PCA is a type of data 
            transformation that is used with multi-dimensional data, 
            such as that provided by multi-spectral remotely sensed 
            imagery. PCA is used for numerous applications including data 
            reduction, change detection, and noise reduction. When used as a 
            noise reduction technique, an inverse PCA is performed, leaving out 
            one or more of the high-order PCA components, which account for 
            most of the noise variance in the original data set. The decision 
            of how many components to leave out of the inverse transformation 
            should be based on an analysis of the PCA output, considering the 
            amount of explained variance in each PCA component.</p>

        <p>The inverse PCA transformation is based on the eigenvectors and 
            eigenvalues contained in the metadata of the component image header 
            files (.dep). These entries are written into the header files by the 
            <a href="PrincipalComponentAnalysis.html"><b><i>Principal Component 
                        Analysis</i></b></a> tool and must not have been 
            modified for the inverse transformation to work properly.</p>
