        <h1>Turning bands simulation</h1>

        <p>This tool can be used to create a random field using the turning 
            bands algorithm. The user must specify the name of a base raster image 
            from which the output raster will derive its geographical information, 
            dimensions (rows and columns), and other information. In addition, the 
            range, in x-y units, must be specified. The range determines the 
            correlation length of the resulting field. For a good description of 
            how the algorithm works, see Carr (2001). The turning bands method 
            creates a number of 1-D simulations (called bands) and fuses these 
            together to create a 2-D error field. There is no natural stopping 
            condition in this process, so the user must specify the number of 
            bands to create. The default value of 1000 is reasonable. The fewer 
            iterations used, the more prevalent the 1-D simulations will be in 
            the output error image, effectively creating artifacts. Run time 
            increases with the number of iterations.</p>

        <p>Turning bands simulation is a commonly applied technique in Monte Carlo 
            style simulations of uncertainty. As such, it is frequently run many 
            times during a simulation (often 1000s of times). When this is the case, 
            algorithm performance and efficiency are key considerations. The tool 
            can optionally be run in 'fast mode' which places the output grid 
            entirely in memory. This may not be possible for larger rasters or 
            on computers with limited memory resources. The 
            <a href="StochasticDepressionAnalysis.html"><b><i>Stochastic 
                        Depression Analysis</i></b></a> tool is an example of 
            a tool that uses the turning bands method for a Monte Carlo based 
            uncertainty analysis to create each of the realizations.</p>
